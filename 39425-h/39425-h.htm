<p>"The sudden death of Sir James Elvyn," said Sir Henry, "and the
deprivation of the fortunes he designed his daughters, you were long
since, Captain Howard, informed of by Jarvis; I must therefore commence
my narrative from the time those circumstances happened.<span class="pagenum" title="Pg&nbsp;2">&nbsp;</span><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2"></a></p>

<p>"With her fortune, Eliza Elvyn lost every attraction in the eyes of my
grandfather, which could render an union between her and his son
<ins title="desiraable">desirable</ins>; and he accordingly forbade my
father to continue his addresses; but, finding his commands were
disregarded, he hurried him to Caermarthen, where he endeavoured to
enforce my father's obedience to relinquish Eliza, and address the
daughter of Mr. Holly: but as every menace proved ineffectual, and
intercepting a letter my father had written to Eliza, proposing an
elopement; Sir Horace placed him in the strictest confinement, and,
leaving the Hall, put in execution the simple piece of finesse by which
he secured the person of Miss Elvyn, and with which you are already
acquainted.<span class="pagenum" title="Pg&nbsp;3">&nbsp;</span><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3"></a></p>

<p>"Sir Horace conveyed her to the Hall, and to a private apartment
adjoining his own; where he resolved she should remain till my father's
marriage with Miss Holly was completed. This was prevented by my
mother's elopement, and my father, seizing the first moment of liberty,
flew to the late residence of his Eliza. She was gone; but where to, he
could not trace! Sir Horace, however, feared it; and, though he had
failed in one point, warily executed a plan, which put it beyond the
power of fate ever to unite her to him.</p>

<p>"Prior to his marriage with my grandmother, he seduced the daughter of
one of his tenants; and by her had<span class="pagenum" title="Pg&nbsp;4">&nbsp;</span><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4"></a> a son; whom, more from a sense of
shame than affection, he had indeed reared and educated; but with a
parsimony, which plainly showed with what reluctance he did it. Joseph,
however, rose superior to every obstruction the avarice of my
grandfather presented, and shone unrivalled in every branch of
literature.</p>

<p>"At college my father first became personally acquainted with him, and,
struck with admiration at his amiable qualities and extraordinary
abilities, soon felt that friendship he merited; and Joseph, equally
pleased at the mildness of my father's demeanour, so different from the
manners of Sir Horace, received and returned his friendship<span class="pagenum" title="Pg&nbsp;5">&nbsp;</span><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5"></a> with an
enthusiastic affection, that ended only with his life.</p>

<p>"In spite of every effort of reason, Joseph never came into the presence
of Sir Horace, without experiencing in some degree the dread he
entertained of him when a child, and which his harshness indeed
justified: Sir Horace's will was an absolute law, to which he had ever
yielded implicit obedience, nor was my grandfather's tyranny over him
then less absolute.</p>

<p>"Joseph was unacquainted with the late transactions; the last letter he
had received from my father, was on the immediate death of Sir James
Elvyn, which he knew had deferred the intended nuptials.<span class="pagenum" title="Pg&nbsp;6">&nbsp;</span><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6"></a> He now, with
surprise, read Sir Horace's invitation to the Hall; the idea, however,
that it was on account of the marriage, and perhaps to perform the
ceremony, as he had taken holy orders, overcame his reluctance of being
with Sir Horace; especially as he regarded the invitation as a proof of
my father's friendship.</p>

<p>"Greatly was he deceived: for on his arrival he was introduced to Sir
Horace, who, after recapitulating the favours he had, or pretended to
have conferred, told Joseph he had sent for him to present him with the
Corbet living, then vacant by the death of the incumbent; but on the
condition that he accepted a wife provided for him. Joseph, recovering
from the surprise this<span class="pagenum" title="Pg&nbsp;7">&nbsp;</span><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7"></a> unexpected donation and overture had occasioned,
thanked my grandfather for a provision so far beyond his hopes; assuring
him at the same time he would obey his command, if there were the least
probability of his proving agreeable to, or liking the lady he had
proposed.</p>

<p>"The lady, Sir Horace said, was perfectly agreeable to the match; she
was handsome and good-natured, and he might look on the living as her
dowry: and finally gave him to understand he was determined on the
match, whether he approved it or not. Joseph silently acquiesced; his
heart was unengaged, and, as I before observed, my grandfather's will
was a law he had<span class="pagenum" title="Pg&nbsp;8">&nbsp;</span><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8"></a> never dared to dispute.&mdash;Satisfied with his tacit
compliance, Sir Horace left him, and went to Miss Elvyn, who was little
prepared for the peremptory command he gave her to marry Joseph."</p>

<p>"I must retire, Henry;" said Mrs. Blond, in vain endeavouring to
suppress the obtrusive tear; "recollection is too painful to let me
listen to the relation. I will rejoin you by and by."</p>

<p>Sir Henry kissed her hand, and conducted her to the door; then,
re-seating himself, resumed his relation.</p>

<p>"Our unhappy friend, who had too fatally experienced to what lengths Sir
Horace dared to go, at first strove, by<span class="pagenum" title="Pg&nbsp;9">&nbsp;</span><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9"></a> tears, to move his obduracy;
but his heart was callous; nor, when roused to anger, were her
reproaches more regarded. Marry Joseph, she should, he was determined.
She gave a positive refusal! She would suffer death first! He had
sanctioned Henry's addresses to her; had witnessed and approved their
reciprocal vows of affection and fidelity; vows which, however he might
then disapprove, it was not in his power to break! Sir Horace's eyes
gleamed fury&mdash;she would suffer death first&mdash;he repeated; then so she
should! For from that apartment she should never go alive, except she
acceded to his proposal.</p>

<p>"He left her, and returning to Joseph,<span class="pagenum" title="Pg&nbsp;10">&nbsp;</span><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10"></a> told him the presentation of the
living should be made out; but as the parsonage wanted a great many
repairs, his marriage should be deferred till it was fit for the
reception of his bride. Joseph marked the contraction of his brow,
acquiesced, and, changing the discourse, ventured to inquire after my
father. He was not at the Hall, Sir Horace said, nor did he expect him
for some time.</p>

<p>"He was, indeed, searching the country for his Eliza: this Sir Horace
knew; and therefore determined, if possible, to force her into a
marriage with Joseph before his return; but the resolution of Miss Elvyn
rose superior to his harshness and ill treatment; and<span class="pagenum" title="Pg&nbsp;11">&nbsp;</span><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11"></a> at the time my
father's nuptials took place, she was still a prisoner.</p>

<p>"After spending some months in endeavouring to find Miss Elvyn, my
father, at the positive injunction of Sir Horace, returned to
Caermarthen; where he passed the greatest part of his time with Joseph,
unconscious that the Hall contained the jewel whose loss he deplored.</p>

<p>"When Miss Holly visited her brother, to intercede for her niece, Sir
Horace again insisted on my father's receiving the fair fugitive as his
wife. My father faintly murmured the name of Eliza.<span class="pagenum" title="Pg&nbsp;12">&nbsp;</span><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12"></a></p>

<p>"'Miss Elvyn,' said my grandfather, exalting his voice, 'is now the wife
of another: she gave her hand to Mallet, Mr. Holly's steward, and is now
with him in France. Read that,' throwing him a letter, 'and be
convinced.'</p>

<p>"My father eagerly took the pretended epistle of Mallet; it was
addressed to Mr. Holly, and, after apologizing for his abrupt departure
from his service, and mentioning some circumstances respecting his late
stewardship, proceeded to inform him of his marriage with Miss Elvyn,
which had taken place through the friendship of Sir Horace, who had
presented him with a genteel competence, on condition of his leaving the
kingdom. That he had accordingly proceeded<span class="pagenum" title="Pg&nbsp;13">&nbsp;</span><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13"></a> to Paris, where he hoped the
amusements of that metropolis, and his attentions united, would, in a
little time, reconcile his wife to her fate.</p>

<p>"The letter answered Sir Horace's expectation; my father knew him
capable of acting in the manner related, too well to entertain a doubt
of the letter being genuine; and looked on Eliza as irrecoverably lost
to him; and, my grandfather repeating his commands with denunciations of
the heaviest curses if he refused, he yielded an unwilling consent, and
two days after attended him to Mr. Holly's, where he was united to my
mother.</p>

<p>"Sir Horace exulted in the success of<span class="pagenum" title="Pg&nbsp;14">&nbsp;</span><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14"></a> his artifice, and became so attached
to his daughter-in-law, that he appeared never to be happy out of her
presence. That happiness, however, was soon after interrupted by the
severe indisposition of my mother; and Sir Horace not only dreaded
losing his favourite; but that my father, should he again be free, might
discover and still espouse Eliza, to whom his hatred had increased to a
most rancorous degree: he, therefore, took the opportunity of my
father's going to visit a neighbouring gentleman; and, sending for
Joseph, reminded him of the condition on which he had given him the
living, and told him he intended his marriage should take place
immediately.<span class="pagenum" title="Pg&nbsp;15">&nbsp;</span><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15"></a></p>

<p>"Joseph's heart revolted at the indelicacy of Sir Horace's proceedings;
but what was his surprise, when he beheld him enter the secret chamber,
and peremptorily tell Miss Elvyn she must, that instant, accept the man
he had provided for her husband!</p>

<p>"'Never!' cried Eliza.</p>

<p>"'This instant, Madam!' vociferated Sir Horace. 'Henry is married to
Miss Holly; nor will I longer be baffled by your refusal.'</p>

<p>"'Henry married&mdash;O God!' she ejaculated. At that moment my father, who
had returned, not finding his friend at home, entered the outward<span class="pagenum" title="Pg&nbsp;16">&nbsp;</span><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16"></a>
chamber, and saw the long-lost Eliza, sinking at his father's feet.</p>

<p>"Poor must be the attempt to describe his emotions at that moment: he
flew to raise her, and on her revival an eclaircissement, dreadful
indeed to him, took place. Sir Horace stamped and raved; but still
declared, she should instantly marry Joseph.</p>

<p>"This Joseph resolutely refused to consent to; and severely reproved him
for the measures he had pursued. Sir Horace did not receive the rebuke
unmoved, and was denouncing vengeance on them all, when my mother
likewise entered, to inform him the clergyman he had sent for, was
arrived. What a<span class="pagenum" title="Pg&nbsp;17">&nbsp;</span><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17"></a> scene for a wife, like my mother: Eliza was weeping on
the bosom of my father!&mdash;there needed no more&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>"Oh, Captain Howard, let me pass what followed! Sir Horace, finding it
impossible to terrify them to compliance, as a last resource, sunk on
his knees, and vowed to fix his eternal curse on my father, if they
longer refused the marriage he had proposed: and began to pronounce a
solemn anathema, when the half-distracted Eliza broke from my father's
arms, and throwing herself beside him, implored for mercy on her Henry:
she would consent&mdash;she would marry Blond!</p>

<p>"Joseph's horror and agitation were<span class="pagenum" title="Pg&nbsp;18">&nbsp;</span><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18"></a> nearly equal to Eliza's, nor dared
he longer urge denial: the clergyman was summoned, and my wretched
father, amidst the taunts and reproaches of his unfeeling wife, was
witness to the marriage!</p>

<p>"This was the last tyranny of which fate allowed Sir Horace to be
guilty. Displeased at a letter, he intercepted, from my grandmother to
my father, he went to Cornwall, and was severely upbraiding her, when
Lady Corbet, who had been some time in a decline, regarded him with a
look of mingled anguish and pity, and, extending her hand to him,
said&mdash;'I forgive you, Corbet; but, oh&mdash;have mercy on my children!' then,
sinking gently back on<span class="pagenum" title="Pg&nbsp;19">&nbsp;</span><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19"></a> her seat, resigned her spirit without a sigh!</p>

<p>"The impressive manner of her last few words, her death, by him so
unexpected, struck to his heart; he felt he had been a tyrant, and had
accelerated an event which must shortly happen to himself; and, for the
first time, wished he had been less severe. The expressive
exclamation&mdash;'Have mercy on my children!' still vibrated on his ear: he
returned to the Hall, from whence he was summoned to the bedside of Mr.
Holly, who died a few days after.</p>

<p>"This was too much, even for the callousness of Sir Horace: horror
filled his bosom; and his constitution, apparently<span class="pagenum" title="Pg&nbsp;20">&nbsp;</span><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20"></a> robust, yielded to
the agitation of his mind; he took to his bed, and for some days
experienced torments unspeakable. Repeatedly he conjured my father, who
never quitted him, to forgive him; and at last desired to see Joseph and
Mrs. Blond; but the appearance of the pale, emaciated Eliza, added to
his agonies: he struggled for breath.</p>

<p>"'Forgive&mdash;forgive me!' he pantingly cried. 'Do not curse me! Oh,
Ellenor! my child, mayest thou find a better friend than thy father has
proved!&mdash;Send for my lawyer this instant&mdash;let me alter my will: for you,
too, Corbet!&mdash;'</p>

<p>"He sunk in the arms of my father.<span class="pagenum" title="Pg&nbsp;21">&nbsp;</span><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21"></a></p>

<p>"At such a moment, could they refuse the forgiveness he entreated? Oh,
no! Death was fast approaching: with a last struggle he seized the hands
of my father and Blond, and, joining them, pronounced an emphatic,
'Bless you!' and immediately expired!</p>

<p>"Mrs. Blond was conveyed to the Parsonage, in a state approaching to
insensibility: my mother was confined to her apartment; but chose to be
present at the opening of the will; where my father, though nominated as
heir, found himself restricted from assisting his sister, or living
separate from his wife, under forfeiture of the greatest part of his
property to the uncontrolled will of my mother, already independent<span class="pagenum" title="Pg&nbsp;22">&nbsp;</span><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22"></a> by
the death of her aunt; or, in case of her demise, from marrying Eliza,
under the like forfeiture to a distant branch of the family.</p>

<p>"To Joseph he left two thousand pounds; and the estate in Cornwall, to
my mother, in addition to her jointure.</p>

<p>"My father felt not the restriction till the arrival of his Ellenor;
but, too well had he proved my mother's disposition, to hazard the
alienation of his fortune from me, who was then about three months old;
he therefore conducted her to Blond's, where she was received with open
arms, and settled to her satisfaction, without infringing the clause in
my grandfather's will.<span class="pagenum" title="Pg&nbsp;23">&nbsp;</span><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23"></a></p>

<p>"That my parents were unhappy, was the first idea I imbibed: and as
reason expanded, every sorrow they felt caused equal anguish in my
heart. No wonder then the settled grief, the pale dejection of my
father, rendered him more dear to me, and imperceptibly added to the
ties of affection; and oft have I wept at the wayward behaviour of my
mother, calculated to make him appear in the eyes of the world as a
tyrant: indeed, her pretended gentleness, and resignation to the choice
of her father, in company, were only to be equalled by her unfeeling
haughtiness and contempt, in private!"</p>

<p>"This is a character, Sir Henry," interrupted Mr. Talton angrily, "Lady<span class="pagenum" title="Pg&nbsp;24">&nbsp;</span><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24"></a>
Corbet, I am certain, by no means deserves!"</p>

<p>"Think not, Mr. Talton," answered Sir Henry, "I wish wrongfully to
traduce my mother. Hear me with patience, and be yourself the judge.&mdash;</p>

<p>"Pride, delicacy, regard for his child, every consideration, forbade his
exposing the duplicity of my mother; and, indeed, had he attempted
it&mdash;it would but have confirmed the opinion, her deep-laid project had
established.</p>

<p>"As home was truly disagreeable to my father, he passed the greatest
part of his time at the Parsonage. His<span class="pagenum" title="Pg&nbsp;25">&nbsp;</span><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25"></a> friendship with Blond suffered
no diminution; and the society of his sister and Eliza, soothed even
whilst it added to his affliction, for the irretrievable loss of the
latter.</p>

<p>"When I was seven years old, I first accompanied him in his daily
visits; and, with Edward, received my instruction from the worthy Blond.
The infant Eliza, too, claimed my father's attention, and, as he traced
in her the semblance of her mother, he would indulge a wish that she
might one day hail him by the name of father!</p>

<p>"Thus passed seven years; when my father showed evident symptoms of a
decline; but not all the entreaties<span class="pagenum" title="Pg&nbsp;26">&nbsp;</span><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26"></a> of my aunt and Blond could urge him
to seek medical assistance.</p>

<p>"Cease, Joseph," he would say, "to importune me. My disease, my brother,
is past all but the power of death to remedy."</p>

<p>"To describe the agonies of my mind, as I saw him sinking to the grave,
is impossible: and none but a son in danger of losing such a father, can
form an idea of them. At last he yielded to my persuasions to try the
air of France, and accordingly set sail for St. Malo's, attended by
Thomas, and two other domestics.</p>

<p>"During his absence, Mallet, who<span class="pagenum" title="Pg&nbsp;27">&nbsp;</span><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27"></a> had so abruptly quitted the service of
Mr. Holly, returned to Caermarthen; and was appointed by my mother to
the stewardship of her landed property. This step was highly
disagreeable to my father, and he determined immediately to return: the
malady of his mind was rapidly destroying his constitution; he
entertained no hopes of recovery, he scarcely wished it; and Sister
Françoise being at that time liberated from her monastic vows, he
escorted her to Plymouth, and then returned to the Hall; where, for the
first time in my life, I heard him reproach my mother for her conduct.
Trivial as the circumstance was, it not only rendered home more
disgusting, but appeared to accelerate his dissolution. At the
Parsonage<span class="pagenum" title="Pg&nbsp;28">&nbsp;</span><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28"></a> only he looked for peace; whither, under pretence of
wandering in the grounds, I used to follow him; my mother having
prohibited my visits to Blond, and my father, from affection, not
wishing me ever to be from his presence.</p>

<p>"At last he became so feeble, as to be incapable of leaving the Hall;
and my mother changing her usual mode of conduct, became attentive, and
even assiduous about him; so much so, that for three weeks previously to
the period which bereft me of the best of fathers, she rarely quitted
him, even for necessary rest and refreshment. The evening, however,
before he expired, she had retired for a few hours repose, and<span class="pagenum" title="Pg&nbsp;29">&nbsp;</span><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29"></a> the
attendants likewise quitting the room, my father looked expressively at
me some moments, and, pressing my hand to his bosom, said,&mdash;'The time
will shortly arrive, my Harry, when I shall moulder into dust, and you
be deprived of him who might almost be termed your only parent. Thy
mother&mdash;but no matter!... Little of happiness have I experienced in this
world; and, but for thee, should quit it without regret. Yet remember,
Harry, she is thy mother! and, whatever may hereafter reach thy
knowledge, let it not for a moment blot from thy mind the sacredness of
that tie!</p>

<p>"'You will be the inheritor of my fortunes; your mother is already well<span class="pagenum" title="Pg&nbsp;30">&nbsp;</span><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30"></a>
provided for; but I charge and entreat you take care of my Ellenor, and
her son: Sir Horace's restriction reaches not to you: and if hereafter
the child of my brother and Eliza should gain your affection, let not
her want of an adequate fortune be a hindrance to your happiness; too
many have already been sacrificed to avarice. Blond knows my sentiments,
and will add a blessing to your father's; he has a copy of my will: the
original you will find in&mdash;&mdash;.'</p>

<p>"The entrance of my mother prevented his finishing the sentence, and her
strict attention afterwards precluded all opportunity of informing me
where he had put his will.<span class="pagenum" title="Pg&nbsp;31">&nbsp;</span><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31"></a></p>

<p>"In the morning Blond, as usual, came to visit my father; and perceiving
a considerable change for the worse, consented to remain, till the life
he prized above his own, should cease to animate its earthly mansion.</p>

<p>"Worthy, affectionate Blond! dear to my memory, must ever be thy
behaviour in that awful hour; when suppressing thy own sorrow, which oft
and oft obtruded to thine eye, thou spakest comfort to the heart of thy
expiring friend, and supportedst the affliction of a son! Rest ye in
peace, beloved pair! Together ye trod the rugged path of life: pure and
sincere was your friendship; and death,<span class="pagenum" title="Pg&nbsp;32">&nbsp;</span><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32"></a> unwilling to divide ye,
summoned both to the same sepulchre!"</p>

<p>The emotions of Sir Henry prevented him from proceeding. At last
recovering, he continued.</p>

<p>"My mother behaved at first with the greatest show of sorrow; and the
tears she shed apparently to the memory of my father, revived every
spark of affection; alas! I perceived not the tempest gathering over me,
and ready to dart its most dreadful vengeance on my head.</p>

<p>"The day after the funeral, had been appointed for the perusal of the
will,<span class="pagenum" title="Pg&nbsp;33">&nbsp;</span><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33"></a> which was, my mother said, with other papers of consequence, in a
private drawer of my father's <ins title="escrutoire">escritoire</ins>. She
desired the attendance of Blond, as the nearest friend of my father;
and, at the stated time, the will was produced, in the presence of him,
a neighbouring clergyman, Mallet, Thomas, Owen, and the principal
domestics; but what was my surprise, to find my mother declared not only
my sole guardian, but heiress of every part of my father's property, the
entailed estates excepted; and from which I was to have an allowance of
only four hundred pounds, annually, during my minority!</p>

<p>"Indignation sparkled in the penetrating eyes of Blond; whilst he
vehemently<span class="pagenum" title="Pg&nbsp;34">&nbsp;</span><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34"></a> declared the will was a false one! 'Here is a copy of the
real one,' he continued, 'which will prove to your shame, Madam, that my
noble brother has chosen a worthier heir than his wife.'</p>

<p>"Quick as lightning my mother tore it from his hands, and the next
instant, forced it between the bars of the grate; whilst, with equal
vehemence, she retorted the charge of forgery, and threatened to deprive
him of his gown for the nefarious action! Never before had I seen Blond
betray the least symptom of passion; and as affection for my mother
prevented my regretting this deprivation of nearly two thirds of my
fortune, I, after the first moment of surprise,<span class="pagenum" title="Pg&nbsp;35">&nbsp;</span><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35"></a> endeavoured to mediate
between them; but Blond still declared my father had left me the whole
of his fortune, under the guardianship of the elder St. Ledger and
himself: and my mother as resolutely declared the will produced, was the
real one, and that by which I should abide; and insulted Blond to such a
degree, as a mercenary intermeddler in the family, that, unable to bear
it, he hastily left the Hall. The speed with which he returned to the
Parsonage, joined to the agitation of his spirits, brought on a fever;
which indignation in seeing me thus deprived of my rights, prevented him
from paying proper regard to; this was increased, the following Sunday,
by his getting wet in going to church; where, unable to change<span class="pagenum" title="Pg&nbsp;36">&nbsp;</span><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36"></a> his
clothes, he was necessitated to perform divine service in those he had
on. The consequence was, that before the end of the second day, he was
confined to his bed!</p>

<p>"During this, my mother, though exulting in the success of her artifice,
behaved to me with her wonted show of affection; but Blond getting
hourly worse, at last entreated to speak with me; and then it was my
mother first unmasked herself to me!</p>

<p>"She peremptorily refused to let me go&mdash;the servant said his master was
expiring! I begged, conjured&mdash;at last insisted! But, looking at me with
that haughty contempt, she had too often regarded<span class="pagenum" title="Pg&nbsp;37">&nbsp;</span><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37"></a> my father
with&mdash;'Recollect yourself, young gentleman,' she said: 'you shall not
go, but where, and to whom I please!&mdash;So far at least I can control you.
Insist!' she repeated with increasing hauteur: 'henceforth, Sir, this
apartment is the boundary of your steps, till you have learned to show
more respect to the will of a mother!'</p>

<p>"She quitted the room, leaving me confounded at a behaviour so
unexpected.</p>

<p>"The expiring Blond, however, took full possession of my mind; in him I
was losing a second father; and as I could not but regard my mother's
denial as unfeeling and unjust, I determined to<span class="pagenum" title="Pg&nbsp;38">&nbsp;</span><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38"></a> obey the impulse of my
heart: but, on trying the door, I found it locked, and, after some
ineffectual attempts to force it, I was obliged to desist; the window,
however, presented the means of escape; I instantly got out, and lightly
dropping to the ground, hastened through the plantations, to the
Parsonage, where I found my worthy uncle, indeed expiring. As soon as he
beheld me, he extended his hand,</p>

<p>"'Welcome, Sir Henry! From the answer your mother returned to my
request, this was a happiness, with which I dared not flatter myself:
nor could I, as she desired, transmit what I had to impart, in writing.
The urgency of the moment must prevent my dwelling on particulars:&mdash;take
this packet, my<span class="pagenum" title="Pg&nbsp;39">&nbsp;</span><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39"></a> Henry; given to my care, by your deceased father, to be
delivered to you, on your attaining your one-and-twentieth year, or
before if occasion required.&mdash;Keep it carefully from the knowledge of
your mother; the contents will explain the reason, and in part account
for her late conduct: for, the will she produced was forged!&mdash;the real
one if not destroyed, you will find in the closet of the secret
apartment: your father, Sir Henry, left you the undivided possession of
his fortune!'</p>

<p>"These were nearly the last words he pronounced, as he expired in
less than an hour after.</p>

<p>"I wonder not, my Eliza, at your<span class="pagenum" title="Pg&nbsp;40">&nbsp;</span><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40"></a> tears; and a richer offering than
those which spring from filial affection, cannot ascend to the throne of
mercy!</p>

<p>"I shall pass over the distress of our friends at this juncture; your
own hearts may best do justice to their feelings. It was late in the
evening, when I slowly directed my steps to the Hall; where I
immediately retired to my own room; but, a few minutes after, was
summoned to attend my mother in the apartment where my father died.</p>

<p>"I obeyed.&mdash;But ah, who can paint the rage with which she addressed me!
After upbraiding me for leaving the Hall, she demanded for what Blond
had so earnestly desired to see me?<span class="pagenum" title="Pg&nbsp;41">&nbsp;</span><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41"></a></p>

<p>"'Your own heart, Madam,' I replied, 'may best answer that question. The
will produced, he says, was not that of my father.'</p>

<p>"'Insolence unparalleled!' she exclaimed. 'Know, Sir, the estates and
property I hold, were bequeathed me by Sir Horace. Your father for years
supported his vagrant sister, and thereby forfeited them to me!'</p>

<p>"'It is strange then, Lady Corbet,' I replied, 'you did not exert your
right during the life of my father; and not make him will them to you
after his decease: but you mistake, Madam; my father never afforded my
aunt the least pecuniary assistance, nor can you prove it.<span class="pagenum" title="Pg&nbsp;42">&nbsp;</span><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42"></a> Her
maintenance has been at the hand of Blond: he was not forbidden to
succour a sister, though my father was.&mdash;Why are you agitated,
Madam?&mdash;Is there not wealth enough for both, without using illegal means
to enrich yourself: or did my mother think her Henry needed the severity
she has this day shown, to induce his assent to her enjoying the whole
of his fortune, had she wished it?'</p>

<p>"I took her hand; but, casting me from her, she said with increasing
agitation&mdash;'The severity you complain of, boy! is nothing to what you
shall experience for this behaviour! From these windows you cannot
escape; this room is your prison; and here you may ruminate,<span class="pagenum" title="Pg&nbsp;43">&nbsp;</span><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43"></a> and learn
to dread the anger of your mother!'</p>

<p>"'Ruminate indeed!' I sighed, as she closed and locked the door&mdash;'for
inexplicable are thy proceedings.'&mdash;But the packet Blond had given me,
he said, would in some measure account for her conduct; to that I
resolved to apply, and, seating myself, broke the seal of this, my
father's last bequest."</p>

<p>Sir Henry drew the packet from his bosom, and, half suppressing a sigh,
read as follows:</p><hr class="chap" /><p><span class="pagenum" title="Pg&nbsp;44">&nbsp;</span><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44"></a></p>




<h2><a name="CHAPTER_II" id="CHAPTER_II"></a>CHAPTER II.</h2>


<blockquote><p>"When these lines, my beloved Henry, reach your hands, time will
have left only a tender remembrance of the name of father! Yet I
trust the affection you evinced for him in life, will make you
regard this his last (though secret) request, and advice.</p>

<p>"Too oft have you heard the relation of my early misfortunes, to
need a<span class="pagenum" title="Pg&nbsp;45">&nbsp;</span><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45"></a> repetition here; but prepare, my Harry, for a tale you
little expect, and which reached my knowledge a few months after my
marriage.</p>

<p>"Some years prior to that event, your mother bestowed her
affections on Mallet, her father's steward; who, at last, asked her
of his master in marriage; but Mr. Holly refused him with the
proudest disdain, and threatened to dismiss him, if he ever again
renewed the subject. Miss Holly proved more favourable to his
addresses, and at the time Sir Horace demanded her as a wife for
me, was in a state advancing to become a mother!"<span class="pagenum" title="Pg&nbsp;46">&nbsp;</span><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46"></a></p></blockquote>

<p>"Just Powers!" exclaimed Mr. Talton. "Do I hear aright? or can I credit
the assertion?"</p>

<p>"My father's veracity, Sir," faltered Sir Henry, "is not to be doubted;
even if my mother's subsequent conduct had not confirmed the
circumstance as true."</p>

<p>"Proceed&mdash;proceed, dear Henry!" cried the agitated Louise. Sir Henry
resumed the relation of his father.</p>

<blockquote><p>"Alarmed at a circumstance which must inevitably have exposed her
shame, she fled for protection to her aunt, and by a well-feigned
tale, not only induced that lady to receive<span class="pagenum" title="Pg&nbsp;47">&nbsp;</span><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47"></a> her; but to promise
secrecy respecting her state, and the place of her retreat: whilst
Mallet, dreading a discovery of their illicit connexion, withdrew
to France; and four months after Miss Holly was delivered of a
daughter, which the aunt undertook to rear; and, at the desire of
her niece, who was wearied of solitude and restraint, waited on Mr.
Holly, to intercede in her behalf. He admitted their excuses,
consented to receive his daughter, and to bury the past in
oblivion; but to prevent her again disappointing him, he informed
Sir Horace of her expected return, and with him projected the
scheme which plunged me into misery!<span class="pagenum" title="Pg&nbsp;48">&nbsp;</span><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48"></a></p>

<p>"A few months after our ill-fated marriage, Mr. Holly's sister
died, leaving the whole of her fortune to your mother in secret
trust, as I not two months since discovered, for her infant
daughter. But avarice is your mother's motto, as well as Sir
Horace's; to that she yielded, and, smothering every softer
feeling, abandoned the child to the care of its father; and,
appropriating the money to her own use, sent a peasant with the
infant Louise to Mallet at Rennes!"</p></blockquote>

<p>Sir Henry was here interrupted by Louise, who, bursting into tears,
said&mdash;"Ah the dreaded secret is explained! Oh, Harland, will you not<span class="pagenum" title="Pg&nbsp;49">&nbsp;</span><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49"></a>
now despise the woman to whom you are united? The conduct of her parents
must stamp indelible shame on her name!"</p>

<p>"The virtues of Louise," said Harland tenderly, "are
all her own, nor can the actions of her parents lessen her for a moment
in my regard."</p>

<p>Sir Henry paused a moment, till the violence of her emotion had
subsided; then continued:</p>

<blockquote><p>"The discovery of these circumstances by the officiousness of the
woman she employed to transport the child, considerably degraded
your mother, in my opinion: had she, indeed, been as amiable as she
endeavoured<span class="pagenum" title="Pg&nbsp;50">&nbsp;</span><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50"></a> to appear in the eye of the world, she might in time
have obliterated Eliza from my heart; but the pity I had felt for
her, as a victim, like myself, of parental tyranny, was then turned
to contempt and disgust: she perceived the change, and soon learned
the cause, and from that time marked me as the object of her
vengeance.</p>

<p>"Already a favourite with Sir Horace, she easily insinuated herself
into his affections, by continual coincidence with his opinion, and
the appearance of personal attachment; and the ascendancy once
gained, bent him entirely to her will. His anger to Ellenor, which
had been gradually subsiding, was by her revived, and artfully
fanned to the greatest height: whilst<span class="pagenum" title="Pg&nbsp;51">&nbsp;</span><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51"></a> the coldness of my behaviour
was exaggerated, and imputed to the affection I still retained for
Miss Elvyn. Enraged at the bare supposition, he made his will,
restricting me from assisting one, or ever marrying the other. Not
satisfied with this, however, as your mother became seriously
indisposed, and fearing I should disregard the sacrifice of my
fortune if again at liberty; he determined to accomplish the design
he had before projected of uniting Eliza to my brother.</p>

<p>"The deaths of Mr. Holly and Sir Horace, were followed, my Henry,
by your birth; nor till you are yourself a father, can you conceive
with what transports I pressed you to my bosom.<span class="pagenum" title="Pg&nbsp;52">&nbsp;</span><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52"></a> In you I
anticipated a future source of happiness; and as my fondness
increased, you became with me (be not surprised, my Henry, if
chance have not yet discovered it) likewise an object of thy
mother's indifference&mdash;and hatred! But, for your sake, I buried my
sorrows in my own bosom; enduring every species of behaviour
studiously calculated to drive me to a separation; and, could I
have been assured you would have enjoyed the property after her
decease, I would not have hesitated a moment in my determination;
but too well did I know her principles to place the power in her
hands.</p>

<p>"The return of my Ellenor and her infant, increased the anxiety
which<span class="pagenum" title="Pg&nbsp;53">&nbsp;</span><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53"></a> preyed on my mind; though I trust, she will do justice to
her brother, in believing his heart never for an instant coincided
with the will of her father.</p>

<p>"For years your mother continued the same unwearied course of
conduct; affecting an outward appearance of submission to me, and
affection to you; whilst in secret she rendered home distasteful,
and embittered every moment I was obliged to pass in her society.</p>

<p>"How different the conduct of Eliza! She, though united to a man
she did not love, learned to esteem him for his virtues; cheerfully
fulfilling the duties of her station, she enjoyed the sweets<span class="pagenum" title="Pg&nbsp;54">&nbsp;</span><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54"></a> of
friendship, and experienced content from internal rectitude. What a
contrast!</p>

<p>"The hours I passed at the Parsonage, with friends so beloved, in
assisting to form the mind of my Henry, I need not recount; but,
comparatively happy as they were, they could not compensate for the
behaviour of your mother, which at last has forced me to an early
grave.</p>

<p>"At your intercession, I consented to visit France; but receiving
intelligence Mallet had revisited Wales, I as hastily returned, and
found your mother had, indeed, renewed her acquaintance with this
her early lover! Unfeeling&mdash;insulting<span class="pagenum" title="Pg&nbsp;55">&nbsp;</span><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55"></a> woman! couldst thou not stay
a few short weeks, till death had left thee free to accept the
lover of thy choice!&mdash;Yet even this I could have excused; nay,
perhaps, have pardoned: but from the private room, I heard them
exulting in the prospect of my death, and projecting plans to
deprive you, my beloved boy, of your inheritance; but the measures
I have pursued, I trust, will render Mallet's schemes abortive.</p>

<p>"By this means, I likewise learned that the infant Louise had been
deserted by its equally unnatural father, who left it exposed at
the Convent gate of St. Ursule. Even your mother, for a moment,
reprobated the inhumanity of the<span class="pagenum" title="Pg&nbsp;56">&nbsp;</span><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56"></a> action; till he informed her the
Abbess had received, and consented to rear the child, as a
foundling from Heaven; but whether it still existed, he knew not.
If it do, (and be it your care, my Harry, to inquire) I charge you
to assist the unfortunate girl; yet likewise respect your mother,
nor wilfully seek to raise a blush of shame on her cheek: let the
consideration, that she is your mother, induce you to pardon what
otherwise you might condemn!</p>

<p>"To you she has ever preserved the appearance of maternal
affection, and, should you inherit her fortune, remember thirty
thousand pounds of it was left by her aunt, for the deserted
Louise; and to her let it be restored.<span class="pagenum" title="Pg&nbsp;57">&nbsp;</span><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57"></a>
But should Mallet, whose hatred to you, I believe, is as unbounded
as his influence over her, induce her to bestow it on himself or
others; forget not, my son, she is your sister, and provide for her
according to the dictates of your own generous heart; to which, I
must likewise leave the care of my Ellenor and her son.</p>

<p>"Large is the fortune you will inherit, and the years of your
minority will considerably add to it. Sir Horace ever designed to
give his Ellenor fifty thousand pounds, which sum, should she be
re-united to the worthy but misguided Howard, you can present her
with; but should her Edward still be denied the knowledge of a<span class="pagenum" title="Pg&nbsp;58">&nbsp;</span><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58"></a>
father, I would have you secure to him, in addition, the estate I
purchased of Howels.</p>

<p>"And now, my Henry, let me mention the subject, which, though
sinking to the grave, will still maintain the superiority of hope
in my bosom,&mdash;that the child of her I once fondly thought to have
called my own, may become your wife. With satisfaction, I have
perceived your youthful partiality for each other, and cherished
every spark of growing attachment. Yet if another should gain your
maturer affection, Heaven forbid that I should thwart your
inclination, or be the means, however indirectly, of uniting you to
a woman you could not prefer to the rest<span class="pagenum" title="Pg&nbsp;59">&nbsp;</span><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59"></a> of her sex. Should you,
therefore, behold another with the eye of prepossession, at least,
regard Eliza as a sister, and give her a portion accordingly.</p>

<p>"And here, my Henry, let me rest. Though scarcely can I bring
myself to resign my pen; but it must be.&mdash;Harry, dear beloved
boy&mdash;dearer far to my heart than life itself, farewell! May every
blessing this transitory state affords, fall to your lot, till we
meet in those realms where eternal happiness rewards the virtuous
and afflicted!</p>

<p style="text-align:right">
"<span class="smcap">H. Corbet.</span>"<br />
</p></blockquote>

<p>"Surprise and concern," continued Sir<span class="pagenum" title="Pg&nbsp;60">&nbsp;</span><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60"></a> Henry, as he folded up the
packet, "for some time absorbed every faculty. Again I perused the
papers, which opened a mother's character to my view, and which the
occurrences of that day had marked as too just. Yet, for what purpose
could she confine me?&mdash;had she not succeeded in obtaining the estates?
at what further then did she aim? I could not resolve the question, but
insensibly reverted to the death of my father. The bed he expired on,
was before me, my destined couch of rest. Nature revolted at the idea,
and revived, with additional poignancy, the remembrance of his last
moments.</p>

<p>"'And Blond too is gone!' I cried, rising, and wildly pacing the room:
'and she who should prove the friend and<span class="pagenum" title="Pg&nbsp;61">&nbsp;</span><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61"></a> guardian of her son, too
surely seeks his destruction!&mdash;But, perhaps, the will is not destroyed:
no one but Blond knew where it was placed.'</p>

<p>"My mother had secured my father's keys; but some months prior to his
decease, he had presented me with one of the private room; which had my
mother known, she would, most probably, have chosen another apartment
for my confinement.</p>

<p>"With a palpitating heart I unlocked the door, and hastily advanced to
the closet, where Blond had said it was deposited; but in vain I
searched; no will could I discover.<span class="pagenum" title="Pg&nbsp;62">&nbsp;</span><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62"></a></p>

<p>"'Too surely, it is destroyed,' I sighed; and at that moment my ear was
saluted by the voice of my mother in the adjoining apartment, which,
indeed, was her own; and, by the familiarity of her address, soon
discovered Mallet to be her companion. I was, indeed, on the spot whence
my father mentioned overhearing a former discourse. Listening
attentively, I heard my mother say&mdash;'You are wrong, Charles. Confining
him in the room where Corbet died, is the only way to effect my purpose.
Naturally of a pensive disposition, the recollection of his father,
forced on his mind by every object, cannot fail still more to deject
him. Could I but find this accursed will, and destroy it, I should not
fear him; but as it is&mdash;there I will keep him, till I either turn<span class="pagenum" title="Pg&nbsp;63">&nbsp;</span><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63"></a> his
senses, or have a fair pretence for saying he is insane; which may
answer as well. Let me once get the entire management of his estates, it
is all I desire.'</p>

<p>"'I never doubted your abilities, Caroline,' said Mallet, 'but cannot
clearly comprehend how you can accuse him of insanity, when the evidence
of the servants must prove to the contrary; and as for really turning
his senses&mdash;your hopes, I am afraid, are rather too sanguine: Sir Henry
is soft in heart; not the head.&mdash;There is an easier way to settle your
pretensions. Were Sir Henry at rest with his father, no one would have a
just right to dispute the validity of the present will; which, if he
live to come of<span class="pagenum" title="Pg&nbsp;64">&nbsp;</span><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64"></a> age, is a thing not at all unlikely to happen.&mdash;If he
were dead&mdash;'</p>

<p>"'The entailed estates,' interrupted my mother, 'would go to the heir at
law, and I should lose eight thousand a year.&mdash;So, no more on that
subject, Sir. He is the son of Corbet, of the man I hated; but I will
not consent to embrue my hands in his blood, though I should glory in
reducing him to the state in which you left Louise!'</p>

<p>"'Well, well, Caroline,' said Mallet, 'I yield: if you can accomplish
your design, far be it from me to dissuade you from it.'</p>

<p>"They proceeded to settle their future<span class="pagenum" title="Pg&nbsp;65">&nbsp;</span><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65"></a> plans, and I retired to the
outward apartment, in a state nearly answering my mother's wishes.</p>

<p>"In the morning, Mallet brought my breakfast. I started from my seat at
his entrance; his injuries to my father, his villanous intentions toward
myself, rose on my tortured imagination, and hurried me nearly to
madness! Impelled by the phrenzy of the moment, I hurled my chair at him
with the utmost force, and levelled him with the floor! The folly of the
action, the moment I had committed it, served to restore my
recollection; for would it not aid my mother in her intentions to accuse
me of insanity? Mallet, perhaps, believed me then deranged, for,
springing on his feet, he with the greatest<span class="pagenum" title="Pg&nbsp;66">&nbsp;</span><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66"></a> trepidation hurried out of
the room. He, however, took care to secure the door, and I was left to
reflect on my want of forbearance to one who, I was certain, would not
pass by the opportunity of injuring me. My prognostic was right: in less
than half an hour, my mother entered the room; her eye glanced with
secret satisfaction on the fragments of china scattered on the floor;
but, advancing to me, she haughtily asked the meaning of the outrage I
had committed? My heart swelled to agony at the question, though
certainly to have been expected. I could not avow the motive which had
instigated me.&mdash;I could not utter a falsehood: and, at last, throwing
myself on the bed, covered my face, and found a slight relief in
groans.<span class="pagenum" title="Pg&nbsp;67">&nbsp;</span><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67"></a></p>

<p>"Still now do her contemptuous taunts vibrate on my ear, as she told me
my new-acquired dignities would not sit graceful on me, if I knew not
better how to sustain the character of a gentleman!</p>

<p>"'They sit not easy on me, indeed, Madam,' I replied with a sigh. 'Would
to Heaven, that he who has borne them since my birth, still existed;
then should I not want a friend&mdash;a parent!'</p>

<p>"'No more of this insolence, Sir,' she retorted;&mdash;'lest you make me
forget I bear that title: and remember, it is in my power to prove an
enemy!'</p>

<p>"'It is indeed!' I repeated. 'I had<span class="pagenum" title="Pg&nbsp;68">&nbsp;</span><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68"></a> at the moment, forgotten you gave
me birth!'</p>

<p>"She darted a look of scorn and anger at me, and desiring me
henceforward to behave with the duty which became me as a son and ward,
left me again to the torments of reflection.</p>

<p>"At noon, Mallet brought my dinner; and an hour after took it away,
untouched.</p>

<p>"For a week I was regularly served by him, and in that time, by means of
the closet, learned that the clergyman who was present with Blond at the
reading of the will, had been presented with the Corbet living; though,
as he refused to resign the<span class="pagenum" title="Pg&nbsp;69">&nbsp;</span><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69"></a> house where he had long resided, Mrs. Blond
was permitted to remain at the Parsonage, at least till a proper
opportunity should occur of turning her out: likewise, that my mother,
wishing to preserve the character she had ever maintained in the opinion
of the world, immediately granted her request, that Blond, as he had
entreated, might be interred in the same vault with my father.</p>

<p>"This act of complaisance, however, was soon followed by one I little
expected.</p>

<p>"On the death of Sir Horace, my father, regarding the legacy bequeathed
to Blond as far less than he had a right to expect, would have added a
considerable<span class="pagenum" title="Pg&nbsp;70">&nbsp;</span><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70"></a> donation to it; but this Blond refused, and was at last,
with difficulty, prevailed on to accept a small but pleasant estate,
which adjoined the Parsonage lands. This, however, from some neglect,
for which I cannot account, but most probably from Blond's unwillingness
to receive it, had never been properly assigned to him; though the rent
was constantly paid to him, and he regarded as the owner.</p>

<p>"This estate, my father, a few months before his decease, informed me he
had, with one more considerable, left in the fullest manner to his
brother. Nevertheless, my mother now reclaimed it and, as no writings
could be produced to prove it Mrs. Blond's, basely wrested<span class="pagenum" title="Pg&nbsp;71">&nbsp;</span><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71"></a> from her the
principal means of her subsistence.</p>

<p>"Nor did she longer delay the execution of her devices to make me appear
insane; but one morning came to the door, and gently tapping, called me
by name, entreating to be admitted.</p>

<p>"'Your Ladyship,' I replied, 'has secured the means of entrance at all
times: why then demand it of me?'</p>

<p>"'What does he mean?' I heard her say, in a voice of concern, to her
maid who accompanied her: 'Henry, dear Henry, I conjure you, open the
door!'</p>

<p>"'If you, Madam,' I again answered,<span class="pagenum" title="Pg&nbsp;72">&nbsp;</span><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72"></a> 'had intrusted me with the
key, I might have complied with your request: but at present would wish
to know for what offence I am treated as a prisoner.'</p>

<p>"'Heavens! how wildly he talks!' she continued to her companion; and
with greater energy begged and entreated to be admitted: whilst every
answer I could return, was by her artifice regarded as a proof of my
insanity by her servant; who did not fail to exaggerate what she had
heard to her companions; and in a few days it was believed, that I was
actually deranged.</p>

<p>"I learned the success of my mother's plan, by my usual channel of
intelligence; and for the future resolved to persevere in<span class="pagenum" title="Pg&nbsp;73">&nbsp;</span><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73"></a> silence; but
it was of no avail; and some months passed, during which it was affirmed
that my confinement was from my own choice.</p>

<p>"In the course of this time, I had frequently renewed my search for the
will, though without effect; but one day, in examining the contents of a
secret drawer, I discovered bank-notes to the value of seven hundred
pounds, which I made no scruple of securing; and determined, should an
opportunity offer, to leave the Hall, and put myself under the
protection of St. Ledger.</p>

<p>"Providence, in this respect proved favourable; for, a few weeks after,
I was awakened in the night, by a person<span class="pagenum" title="Pg&nbsp;74">&nbsp;</span><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74"></a> moaning at my door: thinking
it some new device of my mother, I disregarded it, till I heard the
voice of Thomas lamenting the supposed loss of my reason. I then
hesitated not a moment, but, springing out of bed, soon convinced him
the account he had received of me was false. This worthy servant's joy
was unbounded, and he promised to effect my liberation in the course of
a week; hinting at the same time, that he suspected his lady
participated in the disposition of Sir Horace.</p>

<p>"Thomas kept his word. He soon discovered Mallet was intrusted with the
key; he therefore ventured into his room one night, and perceiving him
in a sound sleep, took the key from his pocket, lightly stepped to my
apartment, and,<span class="pagenum" title="Pg&nbsp;75">&nbsp;</span><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75"></a> with an expression of joy in his countenance not to be
described, proclaimed me at liberty.</p>

<p>"Little preparation was necessary; and, bidding my faithful old servant
farewell, I directed my steps to the Parsonage.</p>

<p>"My aunt and Mrs. Blond immediately rose on hearing who it was; and
after a short conference, I prevailed on them to receive part of the
money I had obtained, as their income was then reduced to little more
than one hundred pounds; for Blond possessed too benevolent a
disposition ever to think of amassing money. He had truly regarded his
parishioners as his children; as such their wants ever found the
readiest relief; and to the<span class="pagenum" title="Pg&nbsp;76">&nbsp;</span><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76"></a> stranger his heart, his hand, and his door
had ever been open!</p>

<p>"After an affectionate adieu, I hastened to the church, where, for some
time, I indulged in an unrestrained sorrow over the ashes of my father
and Blond.</p>

<p>"The appearance of day at length warned me to retire; and tearing myself
from their sacred remains, I ran to the village, where I procured a
horse, and thence directed my course toward London.</p>

<p>"St. Ledger was from home; but I was received with the greatest
cordiality by his amiable wife, your beloved sister Françoise,
Louise&mdash;."<span class="pagenum" title="Pg&nbsp;77">&nbsp;</span><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77"></a></p>

<p>"Sister Françoise, my brother!" cried Louise with vivacity. "Ah, pardon
my interruption: but tell me&mdash;satisfy my curiosity respecting her."</p>

<p>"In a few words, Louise. St. Ledger, the man she was privately united
to, was in his youth the bosom-friend of my father: on his travels, he
saw and became enamoured of the amiable Françoise; and on her father's
refusing him her hand, prevailed on her to consent to a private
marriage. Their intercourse had continued some time, when he was
discovered by Monsieur de Colline, and the consequences which followed
were as you recited them, from the words of Sister Brigide. Françoise
was delivered of a son, who was doomed by the grandfather<span class="pagenum" title="Pg&nbsp;78">&nbsp;</span><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78"></a> to an early
grave; but was preserved and secretly conveyed to St. Ledger, by the old
confident. This soon reached the knowledge of Monsieur de Colline, who
in the first paroxysm of passion, would have sacrificed her life, for
the innocent one she had preserved. He spared her, but on condition of
her taking an oath, never to divulge the retreat of Françoise to St.
Ledger, or to undeceive his daughter respecting the death of her infant;
for he well knew that whilst she supposed her child living, she would
not consent to retire from the world. Poor Françoise was deceived, and
imagining herself bereaved of both husband and offspring, gladly took
shelter from the anger and reproaches of her father and sisters, in the
Convent of St. Ursule. St. Ledger, in the mean<span class="pagenum" title="Pg&nbsp;79">&nbsp;</span><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79"></a> time, after vainly
demanding his wife of her father, searched the country for some miles
round; till, imposed on by a fabulous tale of her death, he, in a state
of mind truly disconsolate, returned with his infant son to England.</p>

<p>"My father went to France at the time of Monsieur de Colline's death.
The circumstances attending the liberation of Françoise were too
publicly discoursed of to escape his knowledge, and he immediately
proceeded to Rennes, where, introducing himself as the intimate friend
of her husband, she joyfully accepted his offer of escorting her to
England.</p>

<p>"Françoise had written to St. Ledger, who, with an impatience equal to
his regard<span class="pagenum" title="Pg&nbsp;80">&nbsp;</span><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80"></a> for this amiable woman, was hastening with his son to
France, to meet her, when my father unexpectedly presented her to his
embrace at Portsmouth, where St. Ledger was waiting for a favourable
wind, to convey him to the opposite coast.</p>

<p>"Since that time their happiness has never had the least interruption;
except from the hymeneal expedition of my friend Henry. They are,
however, perfectly satisfied with his choice of a bride, who, on her
part, appears sincerely attached to the parents of her husband.</p>

<p>"The elder St. Ledger, on his return in the evening, received me with
his usual friendship. To him my father had never divulged the secret of
his unhappiness;<span class="pagenum" title="Pg&nbsp;81">&nbsp;</span><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81"></a> nor could I reveal it: but on his inquiring the reason
of my journey to London, I related what had passed between me and my
mother since the death of my father, and the means she had used to make
me appear insane. St. Ledger listened to my tale with complaisance; but
regarded my conduct as proceeding from youthful folly; and plainly told
me, he should sooner credit the idea of my insanity, than any thing to
the prejudice of Lady Corbet, who, he was well assured, loved me too
well, and was too just, wilfully to injure me or any one! He, however,
requested I would make his house my home as long as I remained in town;
and, at my entreaty, forbore to inform my mother where I was. The
precaution, however, was useless, as Lady Dursley accidentally<span class="pagenum" title="Pg&nbsp;82">&nbsp;</span><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82"></a> saw me,
and wrote to my mother, who immediately came to London.</p>

<p>"With our subsequent rencontre at Sir John's, you are already
acquainted. My mother, on her first arrival in town, designed to have
called on St. Ledger; but, understanding he was at his country seat,
deemed it unnecessary; and, having recovered her emigrant, took leave of
her friends, and reconducted me to the Hall, where, a few days after, I
was again placed in confinement.</p><hr class="chap" /><p><span class="pagenum" title="Pg&nbsp;83">&nbsp;</span><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83"></a></p>




<h2><a name="CHAPTER_III" id="CHAPTER_III"></a>CHAPTER III.</h2>


<p>"The visits of Mr. Talton in some degree restored my liberty: but
solitude was then become my choice; my mind, by constantly dwelling on
the waywardness of my fate, became gloomy; and my wretchedness was
farther encreased, by hearing the exultations of my mother, at the
subjection to which she had reduced me.</p>

<p>"Mallet, nevertheless, wished my death,<span class="pagenum" title="Pg&nbsp;84">&nbsp;</span><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84"></a> under an apprehension that I
might, one day, discover the means which had been used to defraud me of
my possessions; and repeatedly endeavoured to persuade her to let him
administer such drugs as, without leaving any signs of violence, would
quickly send me to the grave.&mdash;This, however, my mother as often
opposed; and, at last declared, if I died, she would marry Talton.</p>

<p>"This arrangement by no means satisfied Mallet, whose real motive, I
believe, was an idea, that if I were dead, he might persuade or terrify
her into a marriage with himself.</p>

<p>"In the mean time, my mother continued her usual mode of behaviour
toward<span class="pagenum" title="Pg&nbsp;85">&nbsp;</span><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85"></a> me; occasionally allowing me the liberty of rambling in the
surrounding plantations, though with two or three servants to watch me,
lest I should again attempt to escape.</p>

<p>"Thus passed more than a twelve-month, when I was taken ill; I loathed
my food; my strength failed me; and repose became a stranger to my
pillow. Frequently I passed the night in pacing my room; or, when the
moon afforded sufficient light, in contemplating the venerable structure
where the ashes of my father rested, or in tracing the different haunts
where he had so often attended me in my juvenile rambles.</p>

<p>"One night, as usual, I deserted my bed, my mind brooding on the ills
which<span class="pagenum" title="Pg&nbsp;86">&nbsp;</span><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86"></a> might befall my Eliza and her friends, if fate should consign me
to the tomb; an event I thought very likely to happen;&mdash;restless, and
not knowing where to fly for relief, I, after some time wandering about
the chamber, unlocked the door of the private room; and, almost
unconsciously, advanced to the spot which had afforded me such a source
of unhappiness.</p>

<p>"Mallet was with my mother, and I soon found a disagreement, of no
trivial nature, had taken place.</p>

<p>"'&mdash;I speak more from a consideration of your safety, Lady Corbet, than
my own,' I heard him say. 'I have many resources which you have not;
and&mdash;I again repeat it&mdash;whilst Sir Henry lives, not only<span class="pagenum" title="Pg&nbsp;87">&nbsp;</span><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87"></a> your property,
but your life also, is in danger: and, a moment's consideration would
make you sensible of what the consequence must be, should Mrs. Blond or
Mrs. Crawton seek the protection of Talton. They have eloquence as well
as you, nor might even their beauty vainly plead in their favour!'</p>

<p>"'Charles, no more!' said my mother. 'You have instigated me thus far,
nor will I now leave half my scheme unaccomplished. If you, Sir, are so
easily intimidated&mdash;I am not! Let them seek his protection&mdash;it will be
of no avail. I have Talton too securely in my toils, to fear any
application they may make!'</p>

<p>"'Perhaps not!' continued Mallet. 'I<span class="pagenum" title="Pg&nbsp;88">&nbsp;</span><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88"></a> do not like trusting to a chance,
when you can proceed on a certainty. What would avail all your fine-spun
policy, if Sir Henry should ever discover the will?&mdash;Your ruin must
inevitably follow; nor will a charge of insanity then avail. With such a
proof in his favour, he will soon find friends to support him; and you
may then wish you had followed my advice. If he were dead, you would be
at least secured in your present property.'</p>

<p>"'Would then he were dead!' ejaculated my mother.&mdash;'But it is impossible
he should ever discover the will; though where Corbet could put it, I
cannot think. But it must and shall be found&mdash;and soon too!'<span class="pagenum" title="Pg&nbsp;89">&nbsp;</span><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89"></a></p>

<p>"Their discourse ceased; but I was too much lost in reflection to remark
it; and stood expecting its continuation, when my mother entered my
apartment. An exclamation of surprise and dismay escaped her, on
beholding the private room open, and anxiously advancing, she discovered
me, my head resting against a pilaster, and my hand pressed to my
beating temples.</p>

<p>"'What mean you, Sir?&mdash;How came you here?&mdash;How dare you enter this room,
without my permission?' she angrily demanded&mdash;her eye quickly glancing
from me to every part.</p>

<p>"'The same reason which brings you here, Madam,' I replied, 'first
induced<span class="pagenum" title="Pg&nbsp;90">&nbsp;</span><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90"></a> me to enter: the hope and expectation of finding my father's
will.'</p>

<p>"'Your father's will!' she repeated. 'What means the boy?'</p>

<p>"'Not to establish my rights on a mother's destruction,' I replied:
'though most undoubtedly to do justice to those she has wronged. Oh, my
mother! in mercy, go no farther; nor thus lay up a source of
wretchedness for thy latter years. Life smiles gaily now, the meridian
of a summer's day; but recollect, that night, however late, must still
succeed. Will not my mother's soul then shrink from its glooms, and
dread to meet the record of her actions?'<span class="pagenum" title="Pg&nbsp;91">&nbsp;</span><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91"></a></p>

<p>"'Knowest thou to whom thou art speaking?' she cried, darting a look of
mingled scorn and fear at me.</p>

<p>"'To my mother!' I replied: 'and as such let her for once listen to me
with patience!&mdash;You must be conscious, Madam, I am not ignorant of the
measures you have pursued, to obtain the greatest part of my father's
property; neither for what reason you now regard and treat me as an
enemy. Believe me, you injure me, if you imagine that for the sake of
regaining those possessions, I should ever wish to expose you to the
censure of the world. Far from my heart be such a thought! I want not
superfluous wealth; for me the fortune inherited from my forefathers, is
amply sufficient. Freely then enjoy what<span class="pagenum" title="Pg&nbsp;92">&nbsp;</span><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92"></a> you have obtained; by me you
shall never be molested. All I ask is the restoration of Blond's
property, and the society of my friends.'</p>

<p>"'Wretches!' she exclaimed. 'You too, I suppose, like your father, would
foster the vagrant Ellenor! But let her, and your friends, as you call
them, beware!'</p>

<p>"'She never injured you, Madam,' I cried; 'and recollect, she is the
sister of the man, to whom you bound yourself by the most solemn ties
before the face of Heaven. For myself I plead not; but as you hope for
mercy hereafter, show it to her and the unhappy Elvyns.'<span class="pagenum" title="Pg&nbsp;93">&nbsp;</span><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93"></a></p>

<p>"'And art thou to prescribe to me?' she contemptuously exclaimed.&mdash;'To
your chamber this instant, Sir; I shall not apply to you for guidance:
and, as you value your existence, dare not again to give such licence to
your tongue!&mdash;Begone, Sir!'</p>

<p>"I obeyed; taking the key from the door as I passed.</p>

<p>"She instantly followed me, and peremptorily demanded it.</p>

<p>"'Excuse me, Madam,' I replied, 'I cannot yield it. It was given me by
my father; and, as master of this mansion, I have an undoubted right to
retain it.'<span class="pagenum" title="Pg&nbsp;94">&nbsp;</span><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94"></a></p>

<p>"'Master of this mansion!' she franticly repeated. 'Never whilst I
exist.&mdash;Thinkest thou I will stoop to acknowledge thy superiority?'</p>

<p>"'Had I not been willing to acknowledge yours, Lady Corbet,' I answered,
'I had not thus long submitted to the restriction you have ordained;
though I do not promise much longer patiently to bear it!'</p>

<p>"She regarded me with a frenzied eye&mdash;'Dost thou threaten too?&mdash;Severely
shalt thou suffer for this! This instant, Sir, deliver the key.'</p>

<p>"'For God's sake, my mother,' I cried, 'do not thus oppress me: long<span class="pagenum" title="Pg&nbsp;95">&nbsp;</span><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95"></a>
have I borne each ill you have inflicted, and nearly without a murmur;
in pity, then, spare me; nor thus add to the sorrows of a heart that is
already nearly broken.'</p>

<p>"'No trifling, Sir; my purpose is fixed; nor, by all that is sacred,
will I be dissuaded from it! I will not be subjected to your control, or
longer kept in awe by your pretensions!'</p>

<p>"'I do not wish it,' I cried; 'all I ask, is that which, if not
possessed by me, cannot devolve to you.'</p>

<p>"She stamped with rage.&mdash;'The key, Sir; this moment give it me.'<span class="pagenum" title="Pg&nbsp;96">&nbsp;</span><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96"></a></p>

<p>"'I have already told your Ladyship, I cannot&mdash;I will not yield it!'</p>

<p>"Never before had my mother experienced such opposition from me. Her
passions, already raised by the insinuations of Mallet, hurried her
nearly to madness; she snatched a pen-knife from the table where I had
been writing, her lips quivered as she grasped my arm&mdash;'Harry&mdash;if thou
darest again refuse&mdash;thou forfeitest thy life!'</p>

<p>"'Then take my life,' I cried; the tears starting to my eyes, and so
agitated that I could scarcely speak; 'when a mother seeks to destroy
it, what hand shall be raised for its preservation!&mdash;Yet think not by
depriving me of existence, to secure<span class="pagenum" title="Pg&nbsp;97">&nbsp;</span><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97"></a> your safety. A charge of lunacy
may screen the action from the knowledge of the world; but there is an
all-seeing eye, Lady Corbet, that would mark it, and make you for ever
dread to meet the face of Heaven!'</p>

<p>"She regarded me with an agitation, that too plainly showed the state of
her mind, then cast me from her with violence, and hurled the knife to
the further part of the room. I was hastening to secure it, when Mallet,
either for the purpose of assisting her to search for the will, or from
a motive of a darker nature, entered the chamber. He started on
beholding me, and, with a well-counterfeited surprise, asked the reason
of my being up at such an unseasonable hour?<span class="pagenum" title="Pg&nbsp;98">&nbsp;</span><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98"></a></p>

<p>"'Where the assassin dwells,' I replied, 'it is requisite to watch,
instead of sleeping!'</p>

<p>"'Assassin!' he repeated as he advanced; when perceiving the knife in my
hand&mdash;'What madness, Sir Henry, have you been attempting? A strait
waistcoat I believe will soon terminate your nightly exploits!'</p>

<p>"My mother here informed him of her finding me in the private room, and
of my refusing to resign the key.&mdash;'A circumstance,' he significantly
returned, 'at which I am not in the least surprised. Your Ladyship will
most probably be very soon convinced, that the measures I advised were
highly requisite.'<span class="pagenum" title="Pg&nbsp;99">&nbsp;</span><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99"></a></p>

<p>"My mother regarded him with an expressive countenance, but was silent,
and Mallet continued&mdash;'It is not yet too late to rectify the error; and
as I know the necessity for it, I shall take the liberty of
dispossessing Sir Henry of the means of future entrance to that
apartment.' Then addressing me&mdash;'I have no time to lose in persuasion,
young gentleman: if you do not peaceably resign the key, I shall use
effectual means to obtain it!'</p>

<p>"'Never from my hands shall you receive it,' I indignantly cried: 'nor
whilst I have life will I part with it. I know the blackened purpose of
your heart too well; but Corbet still has a friend, who will deliver him
from your machinations.'<span class="pagenum" title="Pg&nbsp;100">&nbsp;</span><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100"></a></p>

<p>"'What mean you by that insinuation, Sir?' he ferociously exclaimed.</p>

<p>"'Look on this wasting form,' I replied, 'and let that answer
thee.&mdash;Wretch that thou art, could not thy injuries to my father satisfy
thee, but thou must also seek to destroy his son!'</p>

<p>"He did not receive this imprudent accusation calmly, but seized me with
a strength I had not power to oppose.&mdash;'Since you have taxed me with
such an intention,' he exclaimed, 'it shall not be for nothing. Your
life has long been in my power, though I have weakly spared it!'</p>

<p>"My mother called to him to forbear;<span class="pagenum" title="Pg&nbsp;101">&nbsp;</span><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101"></a> but rage had bereaved him of all
prudence or consideration, and, wresting the pen-knife from me, he
attempted to plunge it into my bosom.</p>

<p>"Quick as lightning, my mother caught his hand, and again commanded him
to desist, or she would instantly alarm the family.</p>

<p>"This declaration recalled him to a sense of his own safety: he sullenly
obeyed; but at the same time asserted that the provocation he had
received, was more than sufficient to authorise what he had done; and,
with many bitter invectives, declared, my insanity should be no defence
for offering him such insults!<span class="pagenum" title="Pg&nbsp;102">&nbsp;</span><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102"></a></p>

<p>"'Your excuse, Sir,' I exclaimed, 'is too absurd to pass even with a
madman; and I am not yet sufficiently bereaved of my senses, to need an
explanation of the motives which instigated you to seek my destruction!'</p>

<p>"'Then I will not attempt one,' he fiercely replied; 'but boldly
say&mdash;Corbet Hall cannot&mdash;nor shall any longer contain two masters!'</p>

<p>"My mother regarded him with a look of ineffable scorn.&mdash;'Surely thou
too art insane!&mdash;Know you not, Sir, where I am, no one shall claim the
title of master? and as you value my good opinion, never again dare to
entertain such an expectation.'<span class="pagenum" title="Pg&nbsp;103">&nbsp;</span><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103"></a></p>

<p>"Mallet was abashed, and, after some moments pause, said&mdash;'Do I rightly
understand you, Lady Corbet?'</p>

<p>"'It appears not, Sir,' answered my mother; 'or you would not thus
insolently assume the privilege of acting contrary to my injunction! But
from this time, Sir, learn that I expect implicit obedience to my will:
if not&mdash;as I have raised, you shall likewise find it is in my power to
replace you in your original obscurity!'&mdash;'To you, Sir,' addressing me,
'I shall only say, that unless you resign the key, I will immediately
bring a charge of lunacy against you: nor shall you ever again pass
beyond the walls of your present apartment!'&mdash;Then ordering Mallet<span class="pagenum" title="Pg&nbsp;104">&nbsp;</span><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104"></a> to
follow her, with an air of the sternest dignity, she quitted the room.</p>

<p>"Mallet knew my mother's temper too well, to irritate her, by a further
opposition to her commands; he therefore slowly directed his steps
toward the door, when perceiving she was beyond hearing, he turned to me
in a menacing manner&mdash;'Next time we meet, young man, your life shall
surely pay the forfeit for this night's adventure!'</p>

<p>"He closed the door; leaving me in a state of wretchedness surpassing
aught I had then experienced. To resign the key, was to yield the only
means by which, as I imagined, I could ever hope to obtain<span class="pagenum" title="Pg&nbsp;105">&nbsp;</span><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105"></a> my father's
will; and would be consigning not only myself, but my aunt, Mrs. Blond,
and all who were dear to me, to ruin!&mdash;To retain it&mdash;or indeed to remain
where I was, would be equally destructive; for Mallet, I doubted not,
would keep his word.</p>

<p>"I stood for some time nearly stupified with horror. 'Is no resource
left to save me?' I at last sighed, advancing to the window. The morning
had dawned, and a gypsey I had two or three times spoken to, was
crossing the lawn toward the house. To me he came the angel of
deliverance; and, allowing myself scarcely a moment's consideration, I
broke a square of glass&mdash;for the windows were too well<span class="pagenum" title="Pg&nbsp;106">&nbsp;</span><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106"></a> secured to admit
of my opening them&mdash;-and called to him.</p>

<p>"He heard me, and immediately approached; when tying five guineas in my
handkerchief, I threw it to him, and briefly telling him my situation,
promised him twenty more if he would aid me to escape.</p>

<p>"He declared himself willing to assist me; but that he knew not how to
effect my liberation. No time, I was certain, was to be lost; I
therefore directed him to an outhouse, whence he procured a ladder,
which he placed against the window, and breaking another square of
glass, severed the wood-work that divided them;<span class="pagenum" title="Pg&nbsp;107">&nbsp;</span><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107"></a> with some difficulty I
got through, and thus, once more, found myself at liberty!</p>

<p>"I gave him his promised reward, and hastened, as fast as my feeble
state would admit, to the Parsonage; where my aunt and Mrs. Blond, on
hearing what had passed, urged me instantly to fly; but not choosing to
put the friendship of St. Ledger again to a trial, or knowing where else
to go, my aunt advised my seeking the protection of her Howard, whose
generous heart, and the remembrance of his Ellenor, she doubted not,
would render him favourable to my suit.</p>

<p>"You were then at Yarmouth; for my aunt had constant intelligence of
your destinations from the time of your quitting<span class="pagenum" title="Pg&nbsp;108">&nbsp;</span><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108"></a> Brighthelmstone; and
refusing the money she would have forced me to accept, I set out on foot
for Hay. But my escape was already discovered. Mallet, early in the
morning, entered my room, and finding me gone, immediately dispatched
the servants in pursuit of me.</p>

<p>"This I learned from old Owen, and was again obliged to have recourse to
the gypsey, who, knowing the urgency of the moment, refused the offer of
my clothes for his, without a considerable gratuity. It was not a time
to argue or deliberate; I therefore paid his demand, and soon found
myself in rags, and with something less than three guineas. I, however,
travelled in safety, though reduced to some distress from the lowness of
my purse, and<span class="pagenum" title="Pg&nbsp;109">&nbsp;</span><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109"></a> at last reached the spot, where the benevolence of my
friend Frederick relieved me from apprehended danger.</p>

<p>"I was beginning to recover my tranquillity, when the appearance of Mr.
Talton drove me from your protection:&mdash;of my subsequent rencounter with
the smugglers, I have already informed you. After my escape from them, I
worked my passage to Cardigan; where, anxious to see my aunt and Eliza,
I proceeded immediately for the Parsonage, secure, as I thought, in my
sailor's habit. The appearance of Mallet drove me to the cottage of
Owen, who informed me of the report circulated of my death, and that
you, Mr. Talton, had previously to your going to Holland, in my mother's
name,<span class="pagenum" title="Pg&nbsp;110">&nbsp;</span><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110"></a> demanded of Mrs. Blond, the back rents of the lands, my father
had attached to the Parsonage, and which my mother had already torn from
her possession."</p>

<p>"'I now,' said Mr. Talton, 'take shame to myself for the action, to
which I was instigated by Lady Corbet, who informed me, Mrs. Blond had
in her house a woman the late Sir Henry had kept previously to his
marriage, and on whom he had since lavished immense sums; that, to
reward Blond for affording her his countenance, he had allowed him the
free rent of the lands; likewise, that she suspected Mrs. Blond was
endeavouring to inveigle you, Sir Henry, into a marriage with her
daughter. I cannot say this account agreed with the characters I ever
received<span class="pagenum" title="Pg&nbsp;111">&nbsp;</span><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111"></a> of Mr. and Mrs. Blond; but such was my affection for your
mother, that I still retained the opinion she had impressed me with. She
did not, she said, want the money; but <ins title="bein">being</ins> certain
they were the instigators of your elopement, she wished to have them
removed to a greater distance, but knew no other means to effect it,
without exposing the conduct of the late Sir Henry, which she would
willingly avoid. On going to the parsonage, I was introduced to a lady I
had never before seen: the beauty of her face and figure, added to the
extreme shyness and embarrassment with which she received me, induced me
to think she was the mistress your mother had mentioned; and I am sorry
to say, I behaved to her with a harshness and severity,<span class="pagenum" title="Pg&nbsp;112">&nbsp;</span><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112"></a> I am now
convinced she did not deserve; but I should sooner have discredited the
evidence of my senses, than the word of your mother; and scarcely,
indeed, can I believe them, in the discovery this day has afforded! But,
I beg pardon, Sir Henry; pray proceed.'"</p>

<p>"Alarmed at the intelligence I received," continued Sir Henry, "I
hastened to the Parsonage, and found it deserted by all but Mary, who
confirmed the truth of old Owen's report: and that, on the news arriving
of my death, they had been obliged to fly, as Mallet had threatened to
send them to gaol. Mary wept as she gave me the relation of their
distress, and at last said&mdash;'Ah! Sir Henry, would to Heaven you had
never left the<span class="pagenum" title="Pg&nbsp;113">&nbsp;</span><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113"></a> Hall; for I heard old Thomas tell my Lady, if you had
staid, and thought of the pannel, all had been well; they should not now
have had to regret your death, or been unjustly driven on a merciless
world, to seek their maintenance.'</p>

<p>"Mary knew not the meaning of what she uttered, but, quick as lightning,
it brought to my recollection a pannel which concealed a small cavity in
a closet adjoining the library. There, I doubted not the will was
placed! The woman my father loved, my aunt, her Edward, and her on whose
happiness I then found mine depended, were wandering without support:
and the idea determined me, regardless of the consequence which must
ensue, should I be discovered, to<span class="pagenum" title="Pg&nbsp;114">&nbsp;</span><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114"></a> venture beneath the roof I so lately
fled from!</p>

<p>"Favoured by the night, I entered by the servants offices, and got,
unperceived, through the library to the closet. Mary had provided me
with a small dark lanthorn, and, with some difficulty I opened the
cavity; but again was doomed to disappointment; it was vacant! With an
aching heart I closed the pannel, and was going to leave the closet,
when my mother and Mallet entered the library. They discoursed on the
improvement of an estate he had purchased for my mother a few weeks
before; till Mr. Talton's name was casually mentioned, when he asked if
she really designed to marry him? and, on her answering in the
affirmative, he<span class="pagenum" title="Pg&nbsp;115">&nbsp;</span><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115"></a> endeavoured to dissuade her from it, and to prevail on
her to bestow her hand on himself.</p>

<p>"'I love you, Charles,' she answered, 'and believe your sentiments are
reciprocal; but will never put it in your power to controul me. I am now
mistress of a noble fortune; and you are welcome to partake of it, even
if increased by that of Talton. Cease then to repeat the only request I
wish to refuse you; and rest satisfied with the title of my lover.'</p>

<p>"He still urged his suit, still she peremptorily forbade the subject,
and reverted to the newly-purchased estate; he soon after retired to his
office, and my mother entered the closet where I was, for the purpose of
writing. Never was<span class="pagenum" title="Pg&nbsp;116">&nbsp;</span><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116"></a> surprise and horror greater than that expressed on
her countenance at beholding me: scarcely could her trembling hand
retain the light which exposed the features of a son to her view.&mdash;'It
is the phantom of the drowned Corbet!' she at length faintly screamed.
'Approach me not! Help&mdash;help!'</p>

<p>"'No, Madam,' I exclaimed, 'your son still lives! and you may now glory
in having reduced him to the state, in which your lover deserted
Louise.'</p>

<p>"I rushed by her, hearing the servants approaching; escaped into the
garden, and, scaling the wall, retraced my steps to Cardigan; every hope
lost of discovering the will, or ever being restored to my<span class="pagenum" title="Pg&nbsp;117">&nbsp;</span><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117"></a> rights.
Cooler reflection, however, offered a different interpretation to the
words of Mary, to what I had at first imagined they implied; and I
thought it not impossible, but even probable, that Thomas had discovered
the will (as he actually had), and conveyed it to my aunt and Mrs.
Blond. But where to trace them&mdash;I knew not. I was moneyless, and
certainly in danger of being discovered by my mother; and the same
precaution they must use to elude the knowledge of Mr. Talton; would, I
feared, as effectually conceal them from me. For some days, however, I
endeavoured to gain intelligence of them, but in vain; and the powerful
demands of hunger, at last, compelled me to engage as a common sailor in
a merchantman trading to<span class="pagenum" title="Pg&nbsp;118">&nbsp;</span><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118"></a> Havre-de-Grace; where, disgusted with the
Captain, I left the vessel, and, having an ardent desire to know if my
deserted sister was in existence, I travelled on foot to Rennes. My
adventures there&mdash;my rescue of Louise, I have already related; till the
period when Providence directed my steps to L'Orient, where, impelled
again by necessity, I engaged to serve in a vessel destined with others
to Pondicherry. The day after we reached St. Helena, you, Captain
Howard, also arrived there, and fortune, there wearied of persecuting
me, not only restored me to your friendship, but discovered to me a
sister, endeared to my heart by her misfortunes, before a personal
knowledge made me love her for her virtues; yet the recollection of past
events, forced continually<span class="pagenum" title="Pg&nbsp;119">&nbsp;</span><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119"></a> to mind by her striking resemblance to my
mother, preyed on my heart. I again sunk under it; and, but for the
attentions of you, my friends, should most probably, ere this period,
have left my mother the lawful possessor of the fortune she now
illegally holds."</p>

<p>"Thank Heaven, my prayers were heard for the preservation of your
existence:" said Louise: "though, had you, my brother, entrusted me with
the secrets you have this day disclosed, Louise would have been your
comforter, and, by sharing your griefs, have lightened the sorrow which
oppressed you."</p>

<p>"Say, rather, have added to it, my dear girl;" said Sir Henry, "from
the<span class="pagenum" title="Pg&nbsp;120">&nbsp;</span><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120"></a> consciousness of having rendered you as unhappy as myself: and but
for the discovery of last night, this of to-day would never have taken
place. For the friends we here found, I wished the recovery of my
fortune; as indeed with them the means rested: and, had not Providence
conducted us to them, should never on my own account oppose her, who,
whatever are her failings,&mdash;is still my mother!"</p>

<p>The company here unanimously joined in thanking Sir Henry for the
elucidation of the mysteries which had perplexed them.</p>

<p>"Yet has he not related every particular," said Ellenor, smiling. "He
might have added, that since the deaths<span class="pagenum" title="Pg&nbsp;121">&nbsp;</span><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121"></a> of his father and Blond, his
hand has not only sustained Ellenor and her son, but the descendants of
Sir James Elvyn.</p>

<p>"On your second emigration, my Henry, your mother, not being able to
discover you, turned the effects of her rage against us, and sent a
peremptory demand, by Mr. Talton, for the back-rents. This message,
which portended our ruin, threw us into the utmost consternation;
though, had I entertained a suspicion the lover of Lady Corbet was the
former friend of my Howard, I should not have hesitated a moment in
discovering myself to him, and appealing to the rectitude of his own
principles against the injustice and inhumanity of the claim. Your
mother, however, at that time, went to<span class="pagenum" title="Pg&nbsp;122">&nbsp;</span><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122"></a> London, and Mr. Talton
accompanying her, in some degree freed us from our fears of immediate
distress; but the following morning, Mallet, attended by an officer,
entered the room whilst we were at breakfast, and arrested Mrs. Blond
for three and twenty hundred pounds, the amount of the rent for
seventeen years.&mdash;Nor was my unhappy friend treated with either respect
or mercy, but, on declaring her inability to discharge the debt,
instantly hurried away to confinement.</p>

<p>"To sue for lenity, I was certain would be in vain, I therefore
(trusting to Sir Henry's friendship, to redress the injury,) paid the
money; consisting of my father's legacy to Blond, which had hitherto
been preserved for Eliza, and the<span class="pagenum" title="Pg&nbsp;123">&nbsp;</span><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123"></a> money Sir Henry had supplied me with,
for my Edward's maintenance at the University.</p>

<p>"Lady Corbet, however, was determined on forcing us from Caermarthen;
for, a few weeks after, we were privately informed by a servant from the
Hall, that he had overheard Mallet threatening to arrest both me and
Mrs. Blond, as joint tenants, for the rent of the parsonage since the
death of Blond, and from Mr. Talton's name being likewise mentioned, he
was induced, he said, to think that gentleman concerned in the
business.&mdash;This relation, added to the late occurrence, considerably
affected the health of Hannah; and she earnestly entreated her sister to
leave the Parsonage, and seek a surer<span class="pagenum" title="Pg&nbsp;124">&nbsp;</span><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124"></a> asylum at the house of Lieutenant
Booyers, at least till we should hear from Sir Henry. Mrs. Blond readily
acceded to the proposal, and, writing for my Edward to return, we
prepared for our departure.</p>

<p>"At that time Thomas returned from Cornwall, where he had been sent some
time before Sir Henry's elopement; and on being informed of that
circumstance, and our sentiments respecting Lady Corbet, he declared he
had supported my brother, when he took his will from the private room,
and placed it in the recess of his closet; but ever supposed it had been
the same which was produced after his decease. He undertook to procure
it; but could not accomplish his design, till the day previous to Lady
Corbet's<span class="pagenum" title="Pg&nbsp;125">&nbsp;</span><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125"></a> return; the library being shut up, and Mallet in possession of
the keys: an opportunity then presented itself, of entering unperceived,
and he found the will, indeed, where my brother had placed it. He
immediately brought it to me; when every ardent hope, the discovery had
raised, was destroyed, by the report of Sir Henry's death. Thomas's
dislike to Lady Corbet being greatly increased by the knowledge of this
action, he determined to follow my fortunes, and attach himself to my
son as his future master. We accordingly proceeded to Lieutenant
Booyers, where the amiable Hannah&mdash;her gentle spirit broken by repeated
afflictions&mdash;sunk beneath this last misfortune, and, a few weeks after,
found a refuge from her sorrows in the grave.<span class="pagenum" title="Pg&nbsp;126">&nbsp;</span><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126"></a></p>

<p>"We were yet mourning her loss, when we were alarmed by Susan informing
us, she had seen you, Mr. Talton, alight at the inn.&mdash;Not doubting but
that you were in pursuit of us, we ordered a carriage from the adjoining
village, and prepared again for flight. On Booyers' return with Ellen,
being made acquainted with the emergency of our situation, he consented
to accompany us, and we thus set out&mdash;Providence our guide&mdash;to seek a
future habitation. Heaven conducted us to this spot, where happiness has
once more become an inmate of my bosom; and where justice, I hope, by
the hand of my Howard, will re-establish Sir Henry in the possessions of
which he has been defrauded."<span class="pagenum" title="Pg&nbsp;127">&nbsp;</span><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127"></a></p>

<p>"My obligations to Sir Henry, on your account, my Ellenor," said the
Captain, "I can never sufficiently acknowledge; indeed every action or
account but heightens my admiration and regard. Let me then know, my
young friend, how you wish to proceed&mdash;and command my fortune and
interest."</p>

<p>"It is now the subject to be considered," said Sir Henry. "Violent
measures we cannot pursue. The will my mother produced is forged: think
then what must be the consequence, if I commence a process of law
against her. No&mdash;rather let me rest satisfied with the entailed estates.
I would wish to appoint you my guardian, for the remainder of my
minority: my mother, at her decease, may perhaps be<span class="pagenum" title="Pg&nbsp;128">&nbsp;</span><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128"></a> just: if
not&mdash;whilst blessed with the friendship of those I so highly esteem, and
as I trust with the hand and affection of Eliza, I shall not only have
sufficient to fulfil my father's request, but to enjoy every comfort of
life: its luxuries I am content to dispense with."</p>

<p>"I cannot agree to this arrangement," said Mr. Talton: "and if you, Sir
Henry, will allow me to be joint guardian with Captain Howard, I may,
perhaps, be able to re-establish you in your rights, without the aid of
the law."</p>

<p>Sir Henry readily consented, on condition that his mother was not
exposed.</p>

<p>"That, Sir Henry," continued Mr.<span class="pagenum" title="Pg&nbsp;129">&nbsp;</span><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129"></a> Talton, "I shall carefully avoid. My
affection to your mother, first founded on personal attractions, was
confirmed only by the appearance of every virtue. Think, then, what must
be my sentiments, at the discovery of her real character. I shall
respect your feelings, my amiable young friends, nor forget that she is
your mother: but these proofs of her duplicity, have raised a sentiment
of indignation, perhaps not altogether excusable, against the woman for
whom I so lately avowed an ardent attachment: but sooner will I tear the
dearest hope, the richest prospect of happiness my fancy could pourtray
from my heart, than be an accomplice in wronging her already too much
injured offspring!<span class="pagenum" title="Pg&nbsp;130">&nbsp;</span><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130"></a></p>

<p>"Misled by her insinuations, I regarded the late Sir Henry as a tyrant,
and her son, as a youth of sordid unsocial principles! I am
undeceived&mdash;and here avow myself the supporter of his cause. Lady Corbet
shall find, that when led into an error, Talton is neither ashamed to
acknowledge it, nor to make reparation as far as lies in his power! Nor
do I think it will prove an improper punishment to her, to be deprived
of her ill-obtained wealth, by the man she pretended affection to, and
would have accepted, with no other view than to increase it. But whether
I succeed or not in this act of justice, you, Sir Henry, shall ever find
a father in me!"</p>

<p>Sir Henry returned his acknowledgements<span class="pagenum" title="Pg&nbsp;131">&nbsp;</span><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131"></a> for the regard Mr. Talton
professed; and began to cherish a hope, that all would yet terminate to
his satisfaction. The re-appearance of Mrs. Blond added to the pleasure
which prevailed: only the bosom of Louise sometimes heaved a sigh, at
the disappointment of the ideas she had cherished, of being restored to
the arms of a mother.</p>

<p>The messenger returning with the licence, arrangements were commenced
for the approaching nuptials. The Captain wished to have secured his
Ellenor an ample competence, independent of himself: but she refused the
jointure, telling him, with a smile, she would not be restricted to a
part of his fortune. They, therefore, agreed to dispense with the
delays<span class="pagenum" title="Pg&nbsp;132">&nbsp;</span><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132"></a> of the law, and appointed the following day for their re-union:
after which, they proposed to proceed to Mr. Talton's, and there wait
the return of Lady Corbet.</p>

<p>Enlivened by genuine gaiety, the hours passed imperceptibly; and the
ensuing morning, Ellenor, for the second time, gave her hand to the man
she loved: and the transports of the Captain on the occasion, showed how
highly he prized the gift.</p><hr class="chap" /><p><span class="pagenum" title="Pg&nbsp;133">&nbsp;</span><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133"></a></p>




<h2><a name="CHAPTER_IV" id="CHAPTER_IV"></a>CHAPTER IV.</h2>


<p>A few days after the marriage, they bade adieu to the humble roof, which
had so many months afforded them a secure asylum; presenting the stock
on the farm, and the furniture, to the peasant, who, with his wife, had
proved themselves zealous and faithful servants.</p>

<p>By pleasant journeys, Sir Henry and his friends proceeded toward the
seat of Mr. Talton, which, as he had informed the<span class="pagenum" title="Pg&nbsp;134">&nbsp;</span><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134"></a> Captain, adjoined to
the Corbet estate.&mdash;On approaching the Parsonage, Edward, who was
conversing with his father, checked the pace of his horse, and, pointing
it out to his observation, said,&mdash;"I can <ins title="scarely">scarcely</ins>, my dear Sir, express
the pleasure I feel in this return to the scenes of my earlier days. How
often have I trodden the spot we are now passing, and plucked the wild
heath from its native soil&mdash;gayly carolling as the lark soaring over our
heads, unconscious of evil, and a stranger to sorrow! Here, too, the
worthy Blond, and my generous uncle, would often join Sir Henry and
myself, in our boyish amusements; and whilst we inhaled health from the
mountain breeze, would, from each object and incident, mix instruction
with our pastime. Here, too,<span class="pagenum" title="Pg&nbsp;135">&nbsp;</span><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135"></a> I last beheld one of the fairest of
nature's creation&mdash;&mdash;."</p>

<p>"Which circumstance," said the Captain, with a smile, "I believe, my
son, you remember with as much regret as pleasure. I have, Edward, from
the time I first beheld you, imagined your cheerfulness to be forced.
Your mother, too, has observed it; and I have wished for the
opportunity, which now offers, of inquiring the cause? Make me your
confident; nor think, in unbosoming yourself, it is to a rigid censor,
but to a father, whose anxiety for your happiness equals&mdash;and perhaps
exceeds your own."</p>

<p>"I doubt not your indulgence, my dear Sir," answered Edward, after a
slight<span class="pagenum" title="Pg&nbsp;136">&nbsp;</span><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136"></a> hesitation: "your heart, I am certain, will afford an excuse for
the wanderings of mine. I have, as you justly observed, affected a
gaiety I am far from feeling, or hope ever again to experience."</p>

<p>"Can you despond," said the Captain still smiling, "with such an example
as the loves of your parents before you? But who is the fair-one, who
has thus gained your affections, and at the same time reduced you to
despair?&mdash;Is she above your hopes, or in a state of life too far beneath
you?"</p>

<p>"Your questions, my father," answered Edward, "add to my distress: I
know not who she is? Her state in life, if I may judge from her
appearance,<span class="pagenum" title="Pg&nbsp;137">&nbsp;</span><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137"></a> is equal&mdash;if not superior&mdash;to my own."</p>

<p>"And when, Edward," asked the Captain more seriously, "did you first see
this object of your regard? Some acquaintance, I suppose, must have
existed&mdash;you could not, I imagine, become enamoured merely from seeing a
fair face?"</p>

<p>"My acquaintance," said Edward, "if it deserve that epithet, with this
truly beloved girl, began nearly three years since. I was returning,
with some of my fellow-collegians, from an evening's excursion, toward
our college; when a horse, on which was a lady, approached with a
rapidity fright only could occasion: the impulse of humanity hurried me
to<span class="pagenum" title="Pg&nbsp;138">&nbsp;</span><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138"></a> her assistance: I caught at the rein, at the moment when,
overpowered by terror, she quitted her hold, and fell senseless to the
ground. I failed in my attempt to stop the affrighted animal, who darted
along with the utmost velocity; but fortunately so far broke the fall of
his lovely burthen, that she received no material hurt. I raised her
from the ground, and recollection was returning, when a gentleman,
followed by his servant, rode up to us; but, to my great astonishment,
instead of expressing any concern at the accident, or inquiring if the
lovely object I held in my arms had sustained any injury, he broke into
violent exclamations of rage at her mismanagement of her steed, and
declared she would only have received her due reward, if she had broken<span class="pagenum" title="Pg&nbsp;139">&nbsp;</span><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139"></a>
her neck! I could not listen to him with patience, but sharply told
him&mdash;I should have supposed he designed her to meet the fate he had
mentioned, by his trusting her on an animal, more fit for the hands of a
horse-breaker than a lady.</p>

<p>"'And who, Sir,' he vociferated, 'asked your opinion of the matter?
Cease your impertinence, or talk to your fellows! For you, Madam, you
shall ride this horse for six months to come: and, if you dare, repeat
this day's behaviour!'</p>

<p>"He then commanded the servant to ride after the horse; in the mean time
I endeavoured to encourage the weeping girl, who, however, was too much
terrified by the menaces of her father, for<span class="pagenum" title="Pg&nbsp;140">&nbsp;</span><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140"></a> such he was, to pay much
attention to me.</p>

<p>"The horse had been stopped by some farmers; and, on the servant's
returning with it, her father peremptorily commanded her to
re-mount.&mdash;'Dear&mdash;dear father,' she cried, wringing her hands, 'do not
insist on it;&mdash;pray let me walk.'</p>

<p>"'Get up this instant,' he replied, 'and do not irritate me, or my whip
shall enforce your obedience!'&mdash;He was going to execute his threat, when
I lifted his trembling daughter on the saddle, and, taking hold of the
bridle, told my companions I would soon rejoin them, then, begging her
to dispel her apprehensions, for I would guide her horse, led it by the
side of her father's.<span class="pagenum" title="Pg&nbsp;141">&nbsp;</span><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141"></a></p>

<p>"She looked her thanks for my care, whilst a faint smile played through
her tears; nor was my precaution useless, as the frequent starts of the
frightened animal plainly showed he would again have hurried his lovely
mistress into danger, if he had not been restrained by a more powerful
hand.</p>

<p>"Her father, as his passion subsided, I believe, became more conscious
of her danger; for when we had proceeded nearly a mile, he stopped, and,
alighting, commanded the servant to change the saddles; the man obeyed
with alacrity, and in a few minutes had the satisfaction of seeing her
on her father's horse; that gentleman mounting the runaway steed; then,
with more politeness than I<span class="pagenum" title="Pg&nbsp;142">&nbsp;</span><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142"></a> expected from his preceding behaviour, he
thanked me for the attention I had shown his daughter: and wishing me
good evening, bowed and proceeded on his way. I remained on the spot, my
eyes directed after them, till they quitted the road, when I slowly
retraced my way to the college.</p>

<p>"This incident remained, with the image of the lovely girl, impressed
for some time on my mind; but in vain I visited every place of public
amusement, or inquired amongst my acquaintance, no one knew the person I
described.</p>

<p>"Time had nearly effaced the circumstance from my mind, when I received
my mother's letter, enjoining me to return<span class="pagenum" title="Pg&nbsp;143">&nbsp;</span><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143"></a> to the Parsonage. I obeyed,
and, the day after my arrival, was going to the cottage of Owen, for the
purpose of meeting Thomas, when, on approaching the spot we have now
passed, I beheld three females, and as many children; one, who appeared
by her dress to be superior to the others, was seated on a ridge of
rock, caressing the infants; one appeared a servant, and the other, by
the loudness of her exclamations and thanks, I discovered to be an
object of charity, whom the beneficence of the first had relieved. I
approached, and with surprise beheld the features of her I had formerly
assisted; but, gracious Heaven, how was every charm improved! She as
instantly recalled me to remembrance, and, with a blush which heightened
every beauty, rose<span class="pagenum" title="Pg&nbsp;144">&nbsp;</span><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144"></a> to return my salutation. At that moment I forgot the
purport of my walk&mdash;my mother&mdash;all but the lovely object before me. In
answer to my expressions of surprise, at meeting her in such an
unfrequented place, she informed me, she was on a visit to a relation of
her mother, who resided not more than two miles off; then, in terms as
elegant as language could express, or gratitude inspire, she thanked me
for the assistance I had formerly afforded her; enumerated each little
circumstance of the adventure, and again repeated her thanks. They led
to other subjects: the woman and her children retired toward the
village, and the time passed imperceptibly, till her maid warned her it
was time to return to the house of her friend. I would have escorted
her;<span class="pagenum" title="Pg&nbsp;145">&nbsp;</span><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145"></a> but she declined my offer, adding&mdash;'As I informed you, I am under
the care of a relation, whose ideas of propriety are too rigidly severe,
to let her pardon such a liberty, should I grant it: and I think you,
who so humanely saved my life, would not wish, even for a moment, to
render that life unpleasant or unhappy.'</p>

<p>"I could urge no farther, and with a smile which nearly compensated for
her refusal, she presented her hand as she bade me farewell.&mdash;My peace
fled with her! Each look, each word, her vivacity, the animation which
sparkled in her eyes, were all impressed on my heart&mdash;and too deeply to
be ever effaced!</p>

<p>"The moment she disappeared from<span class="pagenum" title="Pg&nbsp;146">&nbsp;</span><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146"></a> my sight, I regretted that I had not
asked her name; hope, however, whispered I might soon again behold her,
and, after vainly endeavouring to catch a glimpse of her between the
distant trees, I recalled to mind the cottage of Owen, to which I then
directed my steps. Thomas soon joined me, and with the highest
exultation of joy, informed me he had obtained the will of my deceased
uncle! I hugged the worthy old man in my arms, and with quicker steps
than I went, returned with him to the Parsonage.</p>

<p>"The transports of my mother and Mrs. Blond nearly equalled those of
Thomas, and joyfully did we anticipate the return of Sir Henry, and his
restoration to the honours of his house: but<span class="pagenum" title="Pg&nbsp;147">&nbsp;</span><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147"></a> short-lived was our
promised happiness! The next morning Thomas returned, and with the
bitterest exclamations of sorrow, delivered the account of his death.</p>

<p>"Wretched indeed were the moments which succeeded this intelligence;
for, in him, we had lost our only protector against the wiles of Lady
Corbet: the return of Mr. Talton added to our apprehensions, and the
next morning we privately quitted the Parsonage. My expectation and hope
of again beholding this enchanting girl, were thus destroyed: in my mind
she is ever present; but, from that period I have never beheld her."</p>

<p>"Your heart, Edward," said the Captain<span class="pagenum" title="Pg&nbsp;148">&nbsp;</span><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148"></a> after a pause, "I am afraid, has
been too susceptible: yet my love for your mother was as sudden, and
equalled that of yours for this fair Unknown. You are, however, returned
to the most probable place to gain intelligence of her; if, as she said,
she have relations residing so near Mr. Talton. Seek and inquire after
her; and if you find&mdash;and she prove worthy of you, neither fortune, nor
your father's consent, shall be wanted to ensure your
happiness."</p>

<p>Edward thanked his father with a vivacity he had rarely before shown;
adding&mdash;"Often have I wished to acquaint my mother with my predilection
for this Unknown, and intreat her permission to seek her; but, the
difficulties we have been involved<span class="pagenum" title="Pg&nbsp;149">&nbsp;</span><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149"></a> in, her fear of being discovered,
and her superior fear that I should quit her maternal arms to seek a
father (whom I knew not, till the report of Sir Henry's death, to be in
existence), has repeatedly checked the confidence I ever designed to
place in her."</p>

<p>They continued conversing, till Mr. Talton inquired the cause of their
desertion; when they hastened to rejoin him, and soon after arrived at
the seat of that gentleman; where they received intelligence that Lady
Corbet had returned to the Hall the preceding day.</p>

<p>She had, indeed, been informed, when near London, by a gentleman, whom
she accidentally met, and who was personally<span class="pagenum" title="Pg&nbsp;150">&nbsp;</span><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150"></a> acquainted with Sir Henry,
of his seeing him at Bristol with Captain Howard; she, therefore, gave
up the idea of going to London, and immediately proceeded to Bristol,
where she learned, the Captain had some time since gone on an excursion
into the country; but to what part no one could inform her. Perplexed at
this account, and fatigued with her journey, she resigned her first
intention of pursuing Sir Henry, and resolved to return to the Hall; as
the vigilance of Mr. Talton, she doubted not, would soon recover her
son, without her immediate assistance in the search. To her great
astonishment, a few days after, she was informed Sir Henry was a
visitant at Mr. Talton's; and, unable to reconcile the circumstance with
that gentleman's professions of attachment to herself,<span class="pagenum" title="Pg&nbsp;151">&nbsp;</span><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151"></a> wrote to him, to
request the favour of an interview."</p>

<p>"I shall certainly comply with her Ladyship's desire," said Mr. Talton,
on perusing her note; "as I hope, by alarming her with a pretended
recourse to justice, I shall induce her to resign the estates of Sir
Henry; and, as witnesses may be proper, shall beg the attendance of you,
Howard, and Lieutenant Booyers."</p>

<p>These gentlemen readily assented; but before they were prepared for
their departure, perceived her Ladyship's equipage advancing up the
avenue. Sir Henry started on beholding it.</p>

<p>"Would to Heaven," he cried, "this<span class="pagenum" title="Pg&nbsp;152">&nbsp;</span><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152"></a> interview were over! I think, Mr.
Talton, I had better retire."</p>

<p>"Louise, my love," said Harland, "let me conduct you to your apartment.
Your pallid looks convince me, an interview with your mother ought not
now to take place."</p>

<p>"No, Harland," answered Louise, "let me stay. Long have I ardently
wished to be blessed with the sight of her who gave me being; to hear
the voice of a parent, though circumstances forbid my hoping to receive
a blessing: then, I entreat you, let me stay. Believe me, if I tremble,
it is for her; unprepared to answer so serious an accusation; to meet
those she has so greatly injured!"<span class="pagenum" title="Pg&nbsp;153">&nbsp;</span><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153"></a></p>

<p>Harland reluctantly consented.</p>

<p>"You can stay, my dear girl," said Mrs. Blond; "but, as my presence is
not necessary, I shall beg leave to accompany Sir Henry:" and a servant
then announcing the arrival of their visitant, she took Sir Henry by the
arm, and hastily quitted the room.</p>

<p>With that innate elegance which marked her demeanour, Lady Corbet
entered the drawing-room: the appearance of such an unexpected party,
for a moment checked the smile which played on her lips; but, quickly
recovering herself, she informed Mr. Talton of the report which had
reached her, and begged to know if Sir Henry were actually under his
roof, or if it were<span class="pagenum" title="Pg&nbsp;154">&nbsp;</span><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154"></a> the appearance of the youth she beheld, which gave
rise to the rumour?</p>

<p>"I do not wonder at your Ladyship's perceiving the resemblance of
Captain Howard's son to Sir Henry," said Mr. Talton; "it is indeed an
uncommon one. But this young gentleman is too well known in these parts,
although you, Madam, never before beheld him, to be mistaken for Sir
Henry, who, as you have been informed, is certainly in my house. It was
my intention to have waited on your Ladyship, as I have a circumstance
of some importance to unfold: the present period, however, may answer as
well; and, as Sir Henry has chosen me his joint-guardian with Captain
Howard, we will, if you please, come to the point at once."<span class="pagenum" title="Pg&nbsp;155">&nbsp;</span><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155"></a></p>

<p>Lady Corbet bowed, and Mr. Talton continued&mdash;"Disagreeable is the task I
have imposed on myself: but, as I think it my duty to make reparation,
as far as lies in my power, for the injuries I have, however
unintentionally, committed; your Ladyship must pardon me for espousing a
cause, which will prove so detrimental to yourself."</p>

<p>"I cannot comprehend, Mr. Talton," interrupted Lady Corbet, "to what you
allude; and will thank you to come, as you said, to the point at once.
My son, you inform me, has chosen you his guardian: I would wish to know
from what motive; or what induced you to accept the trust?"<span class="pagenum" title="Pg&nbsp;156">&nbsp;</span><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156"></a></p>

<p>"To reinstate him in his rights, Lady Corbet," answered Mr. Talton; "of
which, I am sorry to say, you have deprived him."</p>

<p>"This is an accusation, Sir," said Lady Corbet, haughtily rising, "you
have no right to make; and an insult I did not expect from you."</p>

<p>"I do not wish to discompose you, Madam," said Mr. Talton, coolly; "pray
be seated. This accusation, though of a most serious nature, is not the
only one I have to offer. Injuries designed against myself I can pardon;
but, not those you wished to make me the instrument of committing toward
others. But this is deviating from the principal charge&mdash;your Ladyship,<span class="pagenum" title="Pg&nbsp;157">&nbsp;</span><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157"></a>
I presume, is conscious the will produced, and by which you hold the
possessions of the late Sir Henry, is a false one?"</p>

<p>"I can now pardon the treatment I have received," answered Lady Corbet,
recovering her composure. "My unhappy son, I perceive, has been relating
a tale, originating in his own distempered imagination: yet, surely, you
might have acted with greater delicacy, than to accuse me thus in
company, even had you, my friend, supposed the improbable account to be
true."</p>

<p>"It is past supposition, Lady Corbet," said Mr. Talton: "proofs have
confirmed its truth. As for Sir Henry being insane, the idea is absurd:
although, I acknowledge,<span class="pagenum" title="Pg&nbsp;158">&nbsp;</span><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158"></a> the treatment he received at your hands, was
more than sufficient to have deprived an indifferent person of their
senses, much less a son, who ought to have expected a different conduct
in his mother!"</p>

<p>"Conduct!" repeated Lady Corbet. "I know not, Sir, what you would
insinuate: but my conduct as a mother, and in every respect, will bear
any scrutiny you can make!"</p>

<p>"It must soon be brought to the proof," said Mr. Talton; "though I
greatly fear it will not stand the test!"</p>

<p>"What mean you, Sir!" exclaimed Lady Corbet, exalting her voice. "I
would not have you imagine, because I<span class="pagenum" title="Pg&nbsp;159">&nbsp;</span><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159"></a> have demeaned myself, by
permitting an intimacy, that you are authorised to treat me with this
freedom! Lady Corbet, Sir, believe me, will not be insulted with
impunity!"</p>

<p>"Have you not deserved this treatment, Lady Corbet?" asked Mr. Talton
solemnly. "Nay more!&mdash;Look round this circle&mdash;here are more than one to
prove the injustice of your conduct. This Lady, you falsely informed me,
your husband kept previously to his marriage&mdash;an abandoned mistress:
and, as such, did you not drive his sister destitute on the
world?&mdash;Demeaned by my acquaintance!&mdash;There sits a living proof of that
existing between yourself and the Steward of your father. This young
lady was left an infant at<span class="pagenum" title="Pg&nbsp;160">&nbsp;</span><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160"></a> Rennes, nearly twenty years since, by
Mallet; and is, as I have been informed, the daughter of her whom I am
now addressing, and entitled to the sum of thirty thousand pounds,
bequeathed in trust to you, by the late Miss Louisa Holly! I mention
these circumstances, Madam, just to convince you&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Spare&mdash;spare my mother!" shrieked Louise, wringing her hands, "I want
no fortune! Force not a parent's curses on my head!"</p>

<p>"Compose yourself, my Louise," said the alarmed Harland; "and let
consideration for your husband calm these transports!"&mdash;But, breaking
from his arms, she threw herself at the feet of the apparently<span class="pagenum" title="Pg&nbsp;161">&nbsp;</span><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161"></a>
horror-stricken Lady Corbet; clasped her hand to her bosom, and, faintly
murmuring&mdash;"Oh my mother!" sunk insensible on the floor.</p>

<p>She was immediately conveyed from the room by her husband, followed by
Mrs. Howard, Ellen, and Eliza. Mr. Talton's agitation, which he in vain
strove to conquer, prevented his immediately proceeding; but, the
Captain perceiving Lady Corbet recovering from her surprise, said,</p>

<p>"I believe, Madam, you will no longer wonder at Mr. Talton's becoming,
with me, the guardian of your son; who, at length, has consented to
commit his cause to the decision of justice: and, the ensuing term, will
commence a suit, which, I am<span class="pagenum" title="Pg&nbsp;162">&nbsp;</span><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162"></a> afraid, will render you an object of
abhorrence in every worthy heart."</p>

<p>"And who art thou?" asked Lady Corbet, scornfully, "or by what right
dare you impute these crimes to me&mdash;or threaten me with an appeal to
justice? The estates&mdash;the property I hold&mdash;are mine; nor can you deprive
me of them. By the will of my husband I hold them; and, protected by the
law, I will enjoy them!"</p>

<p>"The will you hold them by, Madam," repeated Mr. Talton, "is a false
one! and so it shall be proved, to your utter confusion!"</p>

<p>"Assuredly," cried Lady Corbet, "I<span class="pagenum" title="Pg&nbsp;163">&nbsp;</span><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163"></a> ought to discredit my senses, which
tell me it is Talton who addresses me; or, you, perhaps, my good friend,
are affected by the phantasms of your new ward! I can prove him insane
from the evidence of my servants; think then, what weight his accusation
will have in a court of judicature!&mdash;But, if the will, which awarded
this property to me, be false&mdash;where, Sir, is the real one?&mdash;Produce
it!&mdash;and by that, if you can, prove the illegality of my tenure!"</p>

<p>"As I told you, Madam," said Talton, "neither proofs&mdash;nor witnesses,
substantial ones too, are wanting. To oblige Sir Henry, who does not
forget you are his mother, though you have proved unmindful of that tie,
I should have waited on you,<span class="pagenum" title="Pg&nbsp;164">&nbsp;</span><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164"></a> that you might not be unprepared for the
charge: for there are many circumstances, too tedious to be now
discussed, which must be explained in a court of justice! The real will
of the late Sir Henry is found, and now in my possession: from whence it
will pass to that of the Lord Chancellor; together with a packet,
likewise of your husband's writing, containing an account of your
proceedings and conversations with your favourite, Mallet; which he
overheard, by means of a closet in the private room adjoining your
apartment; and by which means, the present Sir Henry is likewise well
informed of every artifice you have used to make him appear insane, and
your intentions to have destroyed the will, could you have discovered
it!"<span class="pagenum" title="Pg&nbsp;165">&nbsp;</span><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165"></a></p>

<p>He was prevented from proceeding, by the horror which appeared in the
countenance of Lady Corbet. An universal trembling seized her frame,
and, had not the Captain supported her, she would have sunk on the
floor: he replaced her on the settee, and when she had in some degree
recovered from this agitation of guilt and fear, he said:&mdash;"A candid
confession on your part, Lady Corbet, with the restoration of the
property bequeathed Sir Henry, by his father, are the only means to
avoid the ruin which threatens you. It is not my wish, nor Mr. Talton's,
far less Sir Henry's, to bring his mother to a public trial; but
justice, either by your hand or ours, shall be rendered him! If you
refuse to afford it him&mdash;all shall be discovered!"<span class="pagenum" title="Pg&nbsp;166">&nbsp;</span><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166"></a></p>

<p>"All is discovered!" cried Lady Corbet, distractedly. "But never shall
Henry triumph over me, in a court of justice! No&mdash;sooner shall my own
hand plunge me into eternity!"</p>

<p>"Little are you prepared for so serious a change," said Talton. "You may
fly from the accusations of a son, but would meet those of a husband,
injured in every respect, before a Being from whom there is no escape:
and whose justice, though blended with mercy, is equal to his power!
Rather, Lady Corbet, endeavour to atone for your past actions, and by a
life of repentance, seek that mercy, you at present so little deserve!"</p>

<p>This address, delivered in a manner,<span class="pagenum" title="Pg&nbsp;167">&nbsp;</span><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167"></a> equally solemn and affecting,
appeared to increase the horror of Lady Corbet.</p>

<p>"Louise, too;" she faintly articulated;&mdash;"would I had not seen her! But
no matter, there is still a resource!"&mdash;She burst into tears; then,
after a moment's pause, hastily continued&mdash;"I presume, Sir, you have
nothing farther to communicate, and I am now at liberty to depart?"</p>

<p>Mr. Talton bowed, and ringing the bell, Lady Corbet, in a state
approaching nearly to derangement, followed the servant to her carriage,
and returned to the Hall.</p><hr class="chap" /><p><span class="pagenum" title="Pg&nbsp;168">&nbsp;</span><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168"></a></p>




<h2><a name="CHAPTER_V" id="CHAPTER_V"></a>CHAPTER V.</h2>


<p>Mr. Talton silently paced the room, some minutes after her departure; he
had gained the triumph over his feelings in this interview, but, he
felt, too dearly, and would cheerfully have resigned half of his
fortune, had Lady Corbet proved herself as amiable as he formerly
thought her. He was soon joined by all the party, except Louise, who was
too ill to leave her apartment; and Sir Henry being anxious to know the
particulars of the interview,<span class="pagenum" title="Pg&nbsp;169">&nbsp;</span><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169"></a> requested him to recount what had passed.
Mr. Talton instantly complied.</p>

<p>"Forbid it, Heaven," Sir Henry ejaculated, as he concluded, "that she
should meditate suicide! Never more should I experience a moment's
happiness! Sooner would I embrace the most abject poverty, than enjoy a
state of affluence by driving a mother to self-destruction!"</p>

<p>"I do not apprehend her Ladyship will commit any act of desperation on
herself," said Mr. Talton: "but rather, as I intended by alarming her,
endeavour to escape from justice, by resigning your possessions."</p>

<p>He was right in his conjecture: Lady<span class="pagenum" title="Pg&nbsp;170">&nbsp;</span><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170"></a> Corbet, justly alarmed at the
discovery of her guilt, and dreading the power of that justice she
pretended to despise, immediately on her return to the Hall, summoned
Mallet, and, informing him of what had happened, ordered him to repair
to London, and withdraw her property, amounting to nearly fourscore
thousand pounds, exclusive of Louise's fortune, from the funds, and
follow her to France.</p>

<p>Mallet by no means approved of her precipitation:&mdash;"I wish your safety,
Lady Corbet," he answered, after a pause; "yet reflect before you
determine on flight. Did Talton produce the will?&mdash;No! Then may not this
accusation be a plan to entice you to confess what, I grant, they may
suspect, but cannot prove! Where&mdash;or<span class="pagenum" title="Pg&nbsp;171">&nbsp;</span><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171"></a> how should Talton have obtained
the will? Sir Henry possessed it not when he quitted the Hall, or this
claim would have been made sooner. But even supposing this account of
their having it to be true, (which I can scarcely credit), may there not
be means to get it from their possession?&mdash;Reflect a little, Caroline,
and if you can keep&mdash;there is no occasion to throw away so much
property."</p>

<p>Lady Corbet hesitated&mdash;"If I can keep&mdash;Charles: but impossible! Talton
too surely has the will: he is not a man either to trifle or be trifled
with. Yet how&mdash;where&mdash;or when he could obtain it&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Is at present," interrupted Mallet, "of very little consequence. Had the
measures<span class="pagenum" title="Pg&nbsp;172">&nbsp;</span><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172"></a> I advised been pursued, this would never have occurred: but as
it is&mdash;all I can say is, if he really have it, means must be found to
get it from him."</p>

<p>"Impossible&mdash;impossible, Charles!"</p>

<p>"Why so, Lady Corbet? Consent to give me your hand if I succeed, and
trust to my management for the obtaining of it&mdash;if in his possession."</p>

<p>"I do consent!&mdash;I will consent to any thing," answered the agitated Lady
Corbet, "on the condition you have named!"</p>

<p>"But one question, then," said her crafty lover: "Where does Talton keep
his papers of consequence?"<span class="pagenum" title="Pg&nbsp;173">&nbsp;</span><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173"></a></p>

<p>"In a cabinet, which stands in his chamber. But wherefore do you
ask?&mdash;What means do you propose to pursue?"</p>

<p>"Forcible ones," replied Mallet, "if I find them requisite."</p>

<p>"Let them be prudent, cautious, and expeditious," said Lady Corbet,
emphatically: "and if danger await me, be quick as fear itself to give
me intelligence!"</p>

<p>They separated; and Mallet, his head teeming with various projects,
proceeded toward Mr. Talton's. On approaching the house, he perceived
the servants were assembled in their own apartment; he, therefore,
confidently entered<span class="pagenum" title="Pg&nbsp;174">&nbsp;</span><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174"></a> by one of the lower windows, and, being well
acquainted with every room, hastened to that Lady Corbet had mentioned.
His heart beat with malicious pleasure on beholding the cabinet; and,
securing the door, to prevent discovery, he lightly advanced, and with
trembling impatience attempted to open the drawers. All, however, were
secured; he then tried various keys, but without effect; and being
certain no time was to be lost, resolutely applied a chissel he had
brought, and forced the lock of the principal drawer. He looked not far
for the will; the hand-writing of the deceased Sir Henry soon met his
view, and, hastily securing his prize, he, with an exulting heart, was
retreating from the chamber, when Sir Henry, who with Harland, had left
the drawing-room to<span class="pagenum" title="Pg&nbsp;175">&nbsp;</span><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175"></a> visit Louise, returned from her apartment. The
figure of Mallet caught his eye, and the appearance of the cabinet
forced open as instantly disclosed the reason of his being there. Sir
Henry sprung to oppose his escape, and seizing him by the collar,
demanded the restitution of the writings he had so feloniously obtained.
Rendered desperate by this unexpected discovery, Mallet, after vainly
struggling for liberation, drew the chissel from his pocket, and aimed a
stroke at the bosom of Sir Henry.</p>

<p>It was too well directed to have failed in its effect, and Sir Henry
must inevitably have fallen a victim, had not Harland, surprised by his
exclamation, hastened from his wife's apartment, and,<span class="pagenum" title="Pg&nbsp;176">&nbsp;</span><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176"></a> perceiving his
danger, torn the destructive weapon from the hand of the assassin!</p>

<p>Mallet was still endeavouring to force his way from Sir Henry, when Mr.
Talton and the Captain, surprised at the scuffle, hastened to the spot,
followed by Frederick, Edward, and several of the servants, who had
likewise been alarmed. The cause was soon explained, and Mallet
effectually secured; he was then searched, and the will, with the packet
written by the deceased Sir Henry, produced.</p>

<p>"Lady Corbet, I find," said Mr. Talton, "is resolved to tear her image
from my heart! By heavens! this last action exceeds all I could ever
have supposed a woman, and a mother, could<span class="pagenum" title="Pg&nbsp;177">&nbsp;</span><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177"></a> have been guilty of!&mdash;For
you, Mallet, your life shall answer for this outrage!"</p>

<p>This last sentence, pronounced with uncommon energy, reached the ear of
Louise, who rushed into the passage.&mdash;"He is&mdash;he is my father," she
cried in a voice of anguish. "Oh, for my sake, have mercy!" She threw
herself at the feet of Mr. Talton, who, with Sir Henry and Harland,
endeavoured to raise her from the floor, as the former said&mdash;"He has
attempted the life of your brother, Mrs. Harland. But retire to your
chamber, this scene is not fit for you."</p>

<p>Harland would have borne her away; but, with the wildest screams, she
broke from him, and threw her<span class="pagenum" title="Pg&nbsp;178">&nbsp;</span><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178"></a> arms round the neck of Mallet, who
appeared as much confounded at her claim, as at the discovery of his
preceding action.</p>

<p>"I am your Louise," sobbed his agitated daughter; "her whom you left at
the gates of St. Ursule.&mdash;Will you not speak to me, and say you are my
father?"</p>

<p>"The name of father," answered Mallet sullenly, "affords no pleasure to
me, but has given a stab to my heart, I never thought to have
experienced. Neither, I think, can it be gratifying to your ears, if you
recollect the treatment you have received at my hands. If you wish,
however, to show yourself my daughter, remind Sir Henry it is not in my
power or your mother's now to<span class="pagenum" title="Pg&nbsp;179">&nbsp;</span><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179"></a> injure him. I am at his mercy; but I do
not expect to find it."</p>

<p>Louise turned a tearful eye to Sir Henry.&mdash;"My brother!" plaintively
escaped her lips, and falling on his bosom, she wept in silence.</p>

<p>"Compose yourself, my dear girl:" said Sir Henry: "the tears of Louise
can never plead in vain!&mdash;Go, Sir," he continued, addressing Mallet, as
he unfastened the cord which confined him.&mdash;"For Louise's sake, you are
free: and that this evening's transactions may teach you a useful
lesson, take with you the forgiveness of the man you would have
deprived&mdash;even of life!"<span class="pagenum" title="Pg&nbsp;180">&nbsp;</span><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180"></a></p>

<p>"I will not oppose your generous sentence, Sir Henry," said Mr. Talton;
"but if you, Mallet, be found in this part of the country to-morrow&mdash;the
next morning, notwithstanding Sir Henry's clemency, you shall certainly
be the inmate of a prison."</p>

<p>Louise wrung her hands, and again burst into tears; whilst Mallet's brow
assumed a deeper gloom: but, as he passed her, he said&mdash;"This is, most
probably, then, Louise, our last interview. As the merit of my release
rests with you, may a better blessing than mine be your reward!" He
descended the stairs, followed by Mr. Talton and the servants; whilst
Louise, satisfied by his liberation and benediction, yielded to
Harland's<span class="pagenum" title="Pg&nbsp;181">&nbsp;</span><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181"></a> entreaties, that she would retire to her own apartment.</p>

<p>In the mean time, Mallet retraced his steps to Corbet Hall; one moment
furious from the loss of the prize he had obtained; the next,
overwhelmed with shame at his detection. Unwillingly he approached Lady
Corbet, who awaited his return with the utmost anxiety and impatience;
eagerly her eyes glanced to catch intelligence from his; they sparkled
not with exultation&mdash;"What hopes&mdash;what success&mdash;what fortune&mdash;await me?"
she hastily interrogated. "Your only hopes&mdash;are in flight!" answered
Mallet, churlishly. "Sir Henry has, indeed, the will to produce, with
the packet Talton mentioned." He then recounted what had<span class="pagenum" title="Pg&nbsp;182">&nbsp;</span><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182"></a> passed: but,
when Lady Corbet learned, the will had actually been in his possession,
and that he had neglected to destroy, the moment he obtained it, her
rage exceeded the power of restraint.</p>

<p>Mallet listened impatiently to her reproaches; and at last said&mdash;"The
best concerted schemes, Caroline, may sometimes be rendered abortive;
nor can I in the least reproach myself for the failure of this. But, it
is useless wasting time in words, which ought to be employed in making
preparations for a safe retreat; and, as our affairs are situated, the
sooner we depart the better."</p>

<p>"But for your foolish prevention, Sir," said Lady Corbet, "I should, ere
this<span class="pagenum" title="Pg&nbsp;183">&nbsp;</span><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183"></a> time, have been beyond the reach of Talton: but you, forsooth,
must raise hopes&mdash;only, by a futile project, to dash them more forcibly
to the ground, and make me more sensibly feel the loss of wealth and
honour, by reflecting, you had it in your power&mdash;but neglected&mdash;to
secure them to me!"</p>

<p>She left him with increasing anger, yet with every fear awake to
apprehended danger. She, therefore, packed up jewels and money to a
considerable amount; and, a little after midnight, set out for Pembroke;
leaving Sir Henry to establish his rights as he thought proper.</p>

<p>In the mean time, Sir Henry experienced a state of anxiety and
wretchedness,<span class="pagenum" title="Pg&nbsp;184">&nbsp;</span><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184"></a> little inferior to Lady Corbet's. He had given the power
of acting as they wished, into the hands of Mr. Talton and the Captain:
his mother, they had promised, should not be exposed: but, he feared,
this last disappointment of her plans, and discovery of her principles,
might, indeed, instigate her to some act of desperation.</p>

<p>His apprehensions were relieved the next morning, when the following
laconic letter was delivered to Mr. Talton:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote><p>"Tell my unnatural son, he never shall triumph over the fall of his
mother!&mdash;By the time this reaches your hands, I shall have bidden
an eternal adieu to England; to seek a retreat<span class="pagenum" title="Pg&nbsp;185">&nbsp;</span><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185"></a> where I may
securely laugh at, and despise both him and the power of justice.</p>

<p>"As Louise's offence of appearing in my presence, I believe, was
unintentional, tell her, I forgive her&mdash;and, some years hence, may,
perhaps, be induced to remember I am her mother.</p>

<p style="text-align:right">
"<span class="smcap">Caroline Corbet.</span>"<br />
</p></blockquote>

<p>The satisfaction of Sir Henry's friends at this event, so much more
favourable than they had expected, could be equalled only by his own, at
the disappointment of his fears, respecting his mother. Cheerfully he
returned their gratulations; till Mr. Talton reminded him, it was
requisite he should go to the Hall, and examine into the state of his
affairs. A carriage<span class="pagenum" title="Pg&nbsp;186">&nbsp;</span><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186"></a> was accordingly ordered, and Sir Henry, accompanied
by Mr. Talton and the Captain, took possession of his paternal
habitation. On inquiring after the retreat of Lady Corbet, the
housekeeper informed them, she had left the Hall, unattended, and in a
hired carriage; and that Mallet was likewise gone&mdash;they knew not
whither.</p>

<p>The tenantry were then assembled; who with satisfaction admitted the
justice of his claim, and openly rejoiced at their young landlord's
succession to the fortunes of his father. On examining the accounts of
Mallet, Sir Henry was induced to coincide with Mr. Talton's opinion,
that his mother had not left England unprovided for; and knowing that
his father, at his<span class="pagenum" title="Pg&nbsp;187">&nbsp;</span><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187"></a> decease, had money to a considerable amount, in the
Caermarthen and Pembroke banks, immediately agreed to his guardians
proposal, of going to those places, that he might be certified what
property he had still remaining. Accordingly, writing to his friends at
Mr. Talton's, to acquaint them with their proceedings, they set out for
Pembroke.</p>

<p>Whilst Sir Henry and his guardians were thus employed, Edward,
authorised by the previous approbation of his father, commenced his
inquiry after the fair Unknown. Nor was the heart of Frederick more at
ease than Edward's: from the time he beheld Ellen at the grave of her
aunt, he had cherished a secret attachment.<span class="pagenum" title="Pg&nbsp;188">&nbsp;</span><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188"></a> Restrained, however, by the
consideration of his dependent state, he would have refrained from an
avowal of his love; but, unused to disguise, the secret of his heart
escaped him: nor could the artless Ellen conceal the delight which
sparkled in her intelligent eyes at the declaration; yet a moment after
saw them suffused in tears.</p>

<p>"Prudence, Frederick," she timidly answered, "must forbid your
encouraging any sentiments of regard for me. I am an orphan, and, though
not friendless, poor in the extreme!"</p>

<p>"I am equally poor, Ellen," said Frederick; "for I have no certainty but
my commission, and might term myself an<span class="pagenum" title="Pg&nbsp;189">&nbsp;</span><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189"></a> orphan, like you, for any
consideration I expect from my parents. Yet, in a few years, promotion
may place me in independence. I have a real and generous friend in my
uncle, though I have no right to expect&mdash;nor do I&mdash;that he should
deprive Edward of any part of his property on my account. I am a sailor,
and must fight for fortune; and cheerfully could I face every danger my
profession exposes me to, if assured the hand of Ellen would at last be
my reward."</p>

<p>"My uncle, Frederick," she replied, "must here direct my
conduct,&mdash;if he approve, Ellen will not oppose your wishes. I want not
grandeur in my establishment for life; but will never marry, to involve
the man I esteem in difficulties,<span class="pagenum" title="Pg&nbsp;190">&nbsp;</span><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190"></a> which may destroy&mdash;instead of
securing&mdash;his happiness."</p>

<p>"Such were my hopes, and such the answer of my Hannah!" said Lieutenant
Booyers, entering from an inner apartment, "May your fate, my children,
prove more fortunate than hers and mine! Frederick, I esteem and respect
you; nor know I the man, on whom I would sooner bestow my Ellen&mdash;the
only treasure I now can boast. You certainly are entitled to a provision
from your father, equally with his other children: if he will settle
five thousand pounds on my girl, I will, with pleasure, consent to your
union; and afterwards, my young friend&mdash;fight for fortune!"<span class="pagenum" title="Pg&nbsp;191">&nbsp;</span><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191"></a></p>

<p>Scarcely could Frederick find words to thank the worthy Booyers for his
generous consent, which raised a hope, that his father, who possessed
nearly eight thousand a year, might be prevailed on to part with the sum
proposed.</p>

<p>He wrote to Sir Arthur immediately: of his uncle's concurrence, he
entertained not a doubt; and impatiently waited the answer which would,
as he imagined, confirm or destroy the happiness of his life.</p>

<p>At last it arrived&mdash;and in an instant doomed him to despair! Sir Arthur,
after expressing his surprise at the application, reminded him of the
Captain's agreement to establish him in life. To him, therefore, he
desired Frederick to make his claim;<span class="pagenum" title="Pg&nbsp;192">&nbsp;</span><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192"></a> and concluded with expressly
forbidding any farther demands.</p>

<p>"Here then end all my flattering prospects of felicity!" sighed
Frederick.&mdash;"Unkind father! Unjustly you condemn me to wretchedness, to
enrich a son, whose regard, I am convinced, does not exceed, nor perhaps
equal&mdash;mine. To my uncle I can never apply&mdash;he has done too much
already."</p>

<p>He pensively paced the room, when the appearance of the Captain roused
him from his disagreeable reflections. The concern he felt was too
deeply impressed on his countenance, to escape the observation of his
uncle, who, perceiving the letter of his<span class="pagenum" title="Pg&nbsp;193">&nbsp;</span><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193"></a> brother lying on the table,
immediately read it.</p>

<p>"This accounts for your unusual dejection, Frederick," he said. "But for
what purpose do you want five thousand pounds?"</p>

<p>The question brought on an explanation. Frederick ingenuously confessed
the state of his heart, and briefly recounted his interview with Ellen
and the Lieutenant. The Captain expressed his approbation of his choice,
and the conduct of Booyers; adding, with a smile, "Your father's
refusal, Frederick, shall never be a hindrance to your happiness. But
where is my Ellenor? I am come to escort her to the Hall, where Sir
Henry<span class="pagenum" title="Pg&nbsp;194">&nbsp;</span><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194"></a> impatiently expects her; Mr. Talton having agreed to remain there
till his affairs are finally adjusted."</p>

<p>Mrs. Howard and her friends were soon informed of the Captain's return,
and the proposed removal; and, leaving directions for the servants to
follow them, they proceeded to the Hall.</p>

<p>Sir Henry received them with open arms, and warmly congratulated his
aunt on beholding her once more beneath her paternal roof. He then
conducted them to the drawing-room, where they were soon after joined by
Mr. Talton and the Captain, who had left them on their arrival. The
latter advanced to his nephew, and, presenting him with a writing,<span class="pagenum" title="Pg&nbsp;195">&nbsp;</span><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195"></a>
said, "This deed, Frederick, I had executed whilst at Pembroke; and
rejoice it is thus in my power to render you happy, by securing you the
means of uniting yourself to an amiable woman. Not that I would have you
regard this as my final intention in your favour. The affection and
attention I have so many years received from you, I can never
recompense: but at my death, or before, if it be requisite, you shall
find me mindful of the obligation."</p>

<p>Frederick opened the deed, which secured to him the sum of twenty
thousand pounds. "My dear&mdash;my generous uncle!" he exclaimed, clasping
his hand with grateful affection, "never can I sufficiently acknowledge
the many instances<span class="pagenum" title="Pg&nbsp;196">&nbsp;</span><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196"></a> I have experienced of your regard. Poor indeed must
be my attempts to thank you; but every act is treasured in the inmost
recesses of my heart!"</p>

<p>The Captain embraced him.&mdash;"Enough, my dear Frederick: if you be happy,
I am fully gratified."</p>

<p>The worthy Booyers, warmly participated in the joy of the moment; and
readily agreed to the Captain's proposal, that the nuptials should take
place at an early period.</p>

<p>Sir Henry, at the same time, took the opportunity of presenting Louise
and his aunt with the fortunes his father had mentioned. The Captain
would have checked his generosity;<span class="pagenum" title="Pg&nbsp;197">&nbsp;</span><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197"></a> but he declared that the wish of his
father should be fulfilled the same as though specified in a legal will.
Then gaily turning to Eliza, he continued, "I must now become a
supplicant! Will you, my beloved girl, consent to bless me with your
hand on the day your friend, Ellen, becomes the bride of Howard?"</p>

<p>"I despise affectation, Henry," answered Eliza: "yet not from me, but my
mother, you must receive your answer. If she grant your suit, I will
cheerfully attend you to the altar."</p>

<p>"Dearest, best of girls!" exclaimed Sir Henry.&mdash;"To you then, my mother,
I must now refer."<span class="pagenum" title="Pg&nbsp;198">&nbsp;</span><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198"></a></p>

<p>"And from that saucy smile on your brow, Harry," said Mrs. Blond,
laughing, "I should suppose, you think yourself ensured of success,
before you ask. I will not, however, disappoint you: the happiness of
Corbet is too dear to my heart."</p>

<p>"Would you, my dear Madam," said Talton, "as readily consent to a
proposal from me, I should rejoice in depriving Sir Henry of his mother:
or rather&mdash;as I ever wished&mdash;to become his father. As Corbet Hall will
so soon own the lovely Eliza for its mistress, I should deem myself
inexpressibly happy, would her mother consent to grace the mansion of
Talton. I have long regarded Sir Henry as my son; I love your daughter
as my<span class="pagenum" title="Pg&nbsp;199">&nbsp;</span><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199"></a> own: and by uniting our families, I flatter myself it would
increase the felicity of all."</p>

<p>"A fair proposal!" said the Captain. "Never demur, my dear Mrs. Blond;
but accede to it as cheerfully as you did to Sir Henry's."</p>

<p>"This proposal," replied Mrs. Blond, in some confusion, "requires
consideration; but my answer shall be sincere."</p>

<p>Mr. Talton urged no farther; and preparations were commenced for the
marriages of Sir Henry and Frederick; when, one morning, a servant
hastily entered, and announced the arrival of a messenger from
Cornwall.<span class="pagenum" title="Pg&nbsp;200">&nbsp;</span><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200"></a></p>

<p>"From Cornwall!" exclaimed Sir Henry. "Good God! what can this mean?
Some fatal accident, I am afraid, has befallen my mother! Show the
messenger up, this instant."</p>

<p>The servant obeyed, and an elderly countryman entered the room. He
advanced with an humble bow to Sir Henry, and, in simple language,
informed him, he rented the principal part of the Cornwall estate,
belonging to Lady Corbet; who was then at the old Mansion-house,
confined by a fractured arm; and as the surgeon who attended her,
apprehended she was in danger, he thought it requisite to acquaint Sir
Henry; more especially as Lady Corbet, who, he acknowledged, was
sometimes delirious, had once expressed<span class="pagenum" title="Pg&nbsp;201">&nbsp;</span><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201"></a> a wish to see him and a
gentleman of the name of Talton.</p>

<p>"I will immediately go to Cornwall," said Sir Henry. "The attentions of
a son may soothe the anguish which oppresses her. And you, Mr.
Talton&mdash;will you accompany me?&mdash;My mother may be worse than she is
represented."</p>

<p>"I will readily accompany you, Sir Henry," said Mr. Talton. "If I have
ceased to regard Lady Corbet with affection, I do not forget the
sentiments I once entertained."</p>

<p>Orders were accordingly given to prepare for their departure, when Sir
Henry anxiously inquired the particulars of the<span class="pagenum" title="Pg&nbsp;202">&nbsp;</span><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202"></a> accident which had
befallen his mother.</p>

<p>Lady Corbet, who, on quitting the Hall, had designed proceeding to
France, altered her resolution before she reached Pembroke; and,
crossing the Channel, went to her estate in Cornwall, where she was soon
after joined by Mallet, and where she proposed to remain, deeming
herself secure from the knowledge of Mr. Talton, till she should learn
his farther proceedings; and whence, if she found it necessary, she
could instantly fly the kingdom.</p>

<p>Mallet had been with her about a week, the tenant informed Sir Henry,
when a disagreement had arisen, which<span class="pagenum" title="Pg&nbsp;203">&nbsp;</span><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203"></a> occasioned his abrupt departure.
That Lady Corbet had appeared very much agitated, and at last commanded
a chaise to be prepared, to convey her to Plymouth; for which place she
set out, but had not proceeded more than half a mile, when, by the
carelessness of the driver, the chaise was overturned, and her arm
severely injured. Lady Corbet was brought, by some country-people, back
to the mansion-house, and a surgeon sent for, who on examining the limb,
declared there was a necessity to amputate it; but Lady Corbet
peremptorily refused to submit to the operation, and desired him to set
the bone, which had been broken in three separate places. He obeyed; but
a fever immediately followed; and, as he had every apprehension of a
mortification<span class="pagenum" title="Pg&nbsp;204">&nbsp;</span><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204"></a> ensuing, he had desired the farmer to hasten and acquaint
Sir Henry.</p>

<p>Sir Henry's countenance assumed a more pallid hue at this relation;
impatiently he inquired if the horses were ready: and on Mrs. Howard
anxiously urging him to take some refreshment before he commenced his
journey, he wrung her hand, saying, "I feel your affectionate care, my
dear aunt; but at this moment my heart is too much oppressed to let me
think of refreshments. Even now&mdash;may not my mother be expiring: ere she
forgives&mdash;or knows how dear she still is to the heart of&mdash;her Henry."</p>

<p>Louise regarded Sir Henry some moments,<span class="pagenum" title="Pg&nbsp;205">&nbsp;</span><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205"></a> with an expressive
countenance&mdash;"Let me too, my brother, accompany you. My humble affection
will not be rejected, and the approving blessing of a mother may yet
reward the years of anxious solicitude, I have experienced."</p>

<p>"You could not, my dear girl," answered Sir Henry, "support the fatigue
of travelling, at the rate I wish to go. Yet follow us&mdash;Harland will
escort you." Harland readily consented, and a chaise was prepared, in
which they departed, in less than an hour after Sir Henry.</p>

<p>In the mean time, Sir Henry and Mr. Talton travelled with the utmost
expedition to Llaugharne, and, crossing the Channel,
proceeded towards the ancient<span class="pagenum" title="Pg&nbsp;206">&nbsp;</span><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206"></a> seat of Lady Corbet. They were received
by Mrs. Brown, the tenant's wife, who informed them the surgeon's fears
were verified; a mortification had commenced, and Lady Corbet, at last
sensible of her danger, had, that morning, desired Sir Henry and Louise
might be sent for. Though prepared for this intelligence, Sir Henry was
still affected on receiving it; he, however, struggled with his
feelings, and requested she would inform his mother of his arrival, and
his wish to see her, if her spirits were equal to the interview. She
soon returned, and conducted him to her apartment. The surgeon and a
female attendant were stationed by the bed, on which, supported by
pillows, was extended the still beautiful Lady Corbet. The fever's
hectic glow had succeeded the light bloom<span class="pagenum" title="Pg&nbsp;207">&nbsp;</span><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207"></a> of health on her cheek; and
the wild lustre of her eye plainly showed reason retained not its full
powers. Sir Henry sprung to embrace her, and in a voice softened by
tenderness and grief, breathed a prayer for the continuance of her
existence.</p>

<p>"I little thought, Harry," she said, after an internal struggle, "ever
to have beholden you again: but retributive justice has overtaken me,
and I must submit to my fate!&mdash;But where is Louise?" she impatiently
continued. "Does she despise the sufferings of a mother; or didst thou
enviously wish to deprive her of a blessing?"</p>

<p>"Ah, my mother," answered Sir Henry, "stab not my heart by such a
supposition;&mdash;in a few hours Louise will be here."<span class="pagenum" title="Pg&nbsp;208">&nbsp;</span><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208"></a></p>

<p>"And in a few hours," repeated Lady Corbet, with energy, "I may be
numbered with the dead!"</p>

<p>"I do not apprehend your dissolution so soon as that," said the surgeon;
"although I thought it my duty to tell you there are no longer any hopes
of your recovery. Yet I would wish you not to increase your fever by too
much exertion in speaking."</p>

<p>"Peace, dotard!" exclaimed Lady Corbet, angrily. "Without thou couldest
bid me live!&mdash;But no&mdash;no&mdash;I must die: there are indeed no hopes for
me!&mdash;Let me see Talton&mdash;they told me he was here." Her attendant
hastened to desire his presence, and the surgeon renewing<span class="pagenum" title="Pg&nbsp;209">&nbsp;</span><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209"></a> his request
that she might be kept quiet, and as composed as possible, retired;
promising to return in the evening. Mr. Talton obeyed the summons. On
his approach, Lady Corbet said: "Thou art come then to behold her, who
would have injured thee to the utmost&mdash;had it been in her power! Rejoice
then in my fall&mdash;exult over my ashes&mdash;and, in the torments I now endure,
be fully revenged!"</p>

<p>"Far be revenge from my heart," replied Talton: "to pity and relieve are
its dictates; but never to triumph over the fallen or afflicted!"</p>

<p>"Well&mdash;well!" said Lady Corbet, with quickness, "I believe thee! Though
were revenge thy wish, thou hast it&mdash;in<span class="pagenum" title="Pg&nbsp;210">&nbsp;</span><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210"></a> its utmost extent! Mallet,&mdash;the
ungrateful Mallet, has deserted me!&mdash;Struck with Louise, and her
behaviour on the evening of his detection, he wished the restoration of
her fortune; but instead of requesting, he commanded it! Had he
entreated&mdash;pleaded her claim to maternal attention and justice, I think
I should have complied! But, unused to commands, I peremptorily refused
him: and, in return, he threatened, by the law's aid, to force me to a
restitution of my aunt's fortune! Rendered furious by this insolence, I
forbade him my sight; and, without seeking to mitigate my anger, he
departed for France. Unable to endure his absence, when my passion
abated, I determined on following him; but fate forbade it, and, by
means of a menial wretch, has torn the fascinating<span class="pagenum" title="Pg&nbsp;211">&nbsp;</span><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211"></a> joys of life from my
grasp, and hurled destruction on my head!" She burst into tears. "All
will soon be over, Harry!&mdash;I rejoiced when Corbet died: he loved
you&mdash;and was beloved: but no one will sorrow or weep for me!"</p>

<p>"Yes&mdash;yes, my mother!" said Sir Henry, "I will sorrow and weep for thee
too!"</p>

<p>"Lay me not, I charge you, Harry," she wildly continued, "by Corbet&mdash;my
ashes must not mingle with his. No, no&mdash;in the vault by my father&mdash;there
I shall rest in peace!" She sunk exhausted on her pillow. Sir Henry
anxiously watched the changes of her countenance, whilst Mr. Talton,
with pity, contemplated the wretched situation of a woman, he once
thought the most perfect of her sex.<span class="pagenum" title="Pg&nbsp;212">&nbsp;</span><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212"></a></p>

<p>A broken slumber shed a partial oblivion over her senses, and for some
hours relieved her from the tortures of remembrance. She awoke more
collected, and impatiently inquired if Louise were arrived? The rattling
of a carriage round the spacious court, announced her approach, and in a
few minutes the agitated Louise was pressed to the bosom of her mother!</p>

<p>"Welcome, Louise!" murmured Lady Corbet.&mdash;"Child of affection, though
thou hast never been regarded as such&mdash;yet I love thee now, Louise.&mdash;And
art thou the husband of my child?" she continued to Harland.&mdash;"Then I
will say thou too art welcome. Poor thou marriedst my Louise; I
therefore believe thou dost<span class="pagenum" title="Pg&nbsp;213">&nbsp;</span><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213"></a> love her; and let not the remembrance of
her mother ever induce thee to slight or contemn her. Mine was the
vice&mdash;be mine the shame: if aught can ever be reflected from Louise! But
no&mdash;no; the virtues of my Louise, like the beams of the morning, shall
rise superior to the darkness of her parents actions!&mdash;Dark, indeed!"
she repeated, with a convulsive sigh.&mdash;"For we deserted thy infant
innocence! Yet forgive me, Louise&mdash;curse not my memory; I will make thee
rich amends for the injuries I have done thee!"</p>

<p>"Name not injuries, my mother;" sobbed Louise; "all is rewarded by this
moment of affection! My love, my duty shall prove me worthy of it."<span class="pagenum" title="Pg&nbsp;214">&nbsp;</span><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214"></a></p>

<p>"I shall not experience them," said Lady Corbet, wildly. "The icy finger
of death has marked the hour of my existence!"</p>

<p>"Not so&mdash;my mother," replied Louise, attempting to speak with
cheerfulness. "My hand shall minister to thy wants; my arm support thee;
affection will teach me the means of relieving thy anguish; and in the
bosom of her Louise, my mother shall yet find peace and happiness!"</p>

<p>"Peace and happiness!" repeated Lady Corbet, franticly. "Oh, torture me
not, by placing to my view blessings I must never enjoy! In thy bosom,
peace and happiness may dwell, but not for me! Even now the grave is
open to receive me,<span class="pagenum" title="Pg&nbsp;215">&nbsp;</span><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215"></a> and all beyond is horror! Thee, I have
injured&mdash;Corbet and his son&mdash;Ellenor too,&mdash;Blond and Eliza&mdash;shall point
the finger of condemnation at me, and say&mdash;'Not one good action marked
her life!'&mdash;Oh, let me live&mdash;Off with this fractured limb&mdash;Tear me to
atoms: let me but live to atone for my crimes!&mdash;The account is too dark
to answer before the Judge I have offended!"</p>

<p>Louise shrunk aghast from her frantic mother, who, with convulsive
eagerness, attempted to tear the bandages from her arm.</p>

<p>Sir Henry endeavoured to restrain her.&mdash;"This must not be, my mother,
you hasten the dissolution you so much dread."<span class="pagenum" title="Pg&nbsp;216">&nbsp;</span><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216"></a></p>

<p>"Hence, audacious boy!" she angrily exclaimed. "Darest thou lay the hand
of violence on thy parent! Now, indeed, thou meritest the hatred I have
shown thee! Yet stay&mdash;stay: let me not add another sin to the number of
my account! I believe thou lovest me, thou hast oft evinced it. Yet, not
to thee can I fly for consolation; the injuries I have done thee, are
too numerous, and alone sufficient to overwhelm me with perdition!"</p>

<p>Mr. Talton drew her fevered hand from Sir Henry's, and gently pressing
it, said, "Raise your heart in prayer, Lady Corbet, and seek for
consolation in the mercy of Heaven!"<span class="pagenum" title="Pg&nbsp;217">&nbsp;</span><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217"></a></p>

<p>"Can I form a prayer&mdash;or ask a blessing," said Lady Corbet, "when every
action of my life is marked with vice? No, no&mdash;there is no mercy for
me&mdash;I never afforded it!"</p>

<p>"Lay your crimes at the feet of your Saviour," replied Mr. Talton,
solemnly: "remember, he died for the sinner: and the first tear shed, of
true repentance, restores you to the bosom of your God!"</p>

<p>The frenzied eye of Lady Corbet rested with piercing keenness on that of
Talton. "Repentance!" she ejaculated. "Oh, if that will avail me, deeply
indeed will I repent. Yet save me&mdash;save me: let me not die! I will be
patient&mdash;calm. But send for the surgeon; I no longer dread a<span class="pagenum" title="Pg&nbsp;218">&nbsp;</span><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218"></a> mutilated
frame: and it may not yet be too late to preserve existence!"</p>

<p>Sir Henry hastily rose&mdash;"I will seek the surgeon this instant&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Not you, Harry!" cried Lady Corbet, extending her hand to detain him.
"Quit not my sight.&mdash;Little as I have loved you through life, I wish not
at this moment to be deserted. Yet, send for the surgeon&mdash;and be quick;
let me but live, and I will atone for all!"</p>

<p>Harland perceiving Sir Henry's distress sent a servant, who soon
returned with the surgeon. On being informed of Lady Corbet's
determination, he shook his head, saying&mdash;"It is now, I am<span class="pagenum" title="Pg&nbsp;219">&nbsp;</span><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219"></a> afraid, too
late. Had she submitted to the operation at first&mdash;all had been well."</p>

<p>Anxiously Sir Henry watched the intelligence of his eye, as he examined
her arm, and with a sigh received the account. It was, indeed, not only
too late to amputate the limb; but her state was such, that the
succeeding day would be the utmost limit of her existence!</p>

<p>A groan burst from the bosom of the wretched patient, who, in agonized
frenzy, alternately entreated the surgeon to save her, and implored the
mercy of Heaven. Medicine was administered to compose her, which, in
some degree, had the effect; and the remainder of the day and following<span class="pagenum" title="Pg&nbsp;220">&nbsp;</span><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220"></a>
night passed in broken slumber and prayer.</p>

<p>The ensuing morning, on awaking, she perceived Sir Henry and Louise
kneeling by her bed; and, regarding them some moments, with a tremulous
voice said&mdash;"And dost thou, Harry, kneel to Heaven, to intercede for thy
guilty parent?&mdash;Oh God! accept his prayers, though mine be rejected! and
for each ill I have&mdash;and would have done him, shower a blessing on his
head! But I must be quick. Reason totters, and life beats uncertain at
my heart. Talton&mdash;Harland&mdash;come hither. Pursue not Mallet. The wealth he
has taken&mdash;let him retain! Let Louise's fortune be restored, and the
rest of my property equally divided between her and her<span class="pagenum" title="Pg&nbsp;221">&nbsp;</span><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221"></a> brother&mdash;except
my picture; which, Talton, I would wish you to have; and, when you view
the resemblance, let pity draw a veil over my vices, and waft a prayer
to Heaven&mdash;they may there be forgiven!&mdash;Pray for me, my gentle
Louise!&mdash;Harry, forgive thy mother. Leave me not whilst a symptom of
life remains; bear with my wanderings, and whilst I have sense to give
it&mdash;receive a last blessing!"</p>

<p>&mdash;Life, however, was not so near its close, though it fluctuated in its
channels. Repeated faintings prepared them for the last awful moment.
Sir Henry and Louise, as Lady Corbet had requested, never left her; and
evening was fast closing as she faintly grasped the hand of<span class="pagenum" title="Pg&nbsp;222">&nbsp;</span><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222"></a> Sir
Henry&mdash;drew him nearer to her, and, sighing a broken prayer&mdash;expired on
the bosom of Louise!&mdash;</p><hr class="chap" /><p><span class="pagenum" title="Pg&nbsp;223">&nbsp;</span><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223"></a></p>




<h2><a name="CHAPTER_VI" id="CHAPTER_VI"></a>CHAPTER VI.</h2>


<p>A piercing scream from Louise as she sunk insensible by the side
of her mother, roused Mr. Talton and Harland from a serious reflexion on
the object before them. The Lieutenant gently raised and conveyed her to
an adjoining room, where, by the assistance of Mrs. Brown, life soon
returned. He attempted not to restrain the first effusions of filial
sorrow; the heart of Louise, he knew, was the seat of sensibility; but
fortitude and religion<span class="pagenum" title="Pg&nbsp;224">&nbsp;</span><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224"></a> were likewise its inmates. In the latter she
found a resource; and he had soon the satisfaction of seeing her
features impressed with a mild though sad serenity.</p>

<p>Sir Henry and Mr. Talton, in the mean time, silently retired to pay that
tribute to the memory of Lady Corbet, she had not altogether merited;
but, to Sir Henry, the last moments of her life had atoned for her
preceding conduct: nor could Mr. Talton retain a spark of resentment for
her ungenerous behaviour to himself: over her actions he drew the veil
of oblivion, and gave a sigh and tear of pity to the untimely close of
her existence.</p>

<p>The next morning he conferred with Sir Henry, and, at his desire,
undertook<span class="pagenum" title="Pg&nbsp;225">&nbsp;</span><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225"></a> the care of the funeral. As Lady Corbet had requested, her
remains were conveyed to Holly seat, and deposited in the vault, by her
father. Mr. Talton, Sir Henry, and Harland attended; nor would Louise be
debarred from paying this final mark of respect to her mother; and a
last tear fell on her coffin, as she silently preferred a prayer, that,
with her ashes, the remembrance of her vices might be for ever buried
from the world!</p>

<p>With minds depressed from the scenes they had so lately witnessed, they
were reconveyed to Corbet Hall, where, to the surprise of Sir Henry, he
was informed the Captain and Frederick were at Sir Arthur Howard's.<span class="pagenum" title="Pg&nbsp;226">&nbsp;</span><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226"></a></p>

<p>Two days, indeed, after he set out for Cornwall, Frederick received a
letter from Lady Howard, to acquaint him with the death of his brother,
who, in hunting, had been thrown from his horse, and killed on the spot:
and, as the violence of Sir Arthur's grief, at this untimely loss of his
favourite son, had brought on a severe illness, she had written to
request his immediate presence, with that of the Captain.</p>

<p>They accordingly took a hasty leave of their friends, and returned with
the messenger to Howard Hall, where they were received by Lady Howard,
and an affecting interview took place between her and her son: nor was
the Captain unwelcomed; she had ever felt for him the affection of a
sister; but, as duty was<span class="pagenum" title="Pg&nbsp;227">&nbsp;</span><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227"></a> her first consideration, yielded to the
imperious commands of her husband, that he should from that time be
regarded as an alien to the family.</p>

<p>Sir Arthur, she informed them, was still confined to his bed; the
violence of his grief, which they at first apprehended would have
destroyed his reason, had exhausted itself; and he was then sunk into a
gloomy sorrow, which threatened to retain a longer influence on his
mind; the arrival of the Captain and Frederick (now the heir to his
title and estates), she, however, hoped, would not only rouse him from
an unavailing grief, but be the means of effecting a perfect
reconciliation between them.<span class="pagenum" title="Pg&nbsp;228">&nbsp;</span><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228"></a></p>

<p>Lady Howard was right. The attentions of his brother and son proved
highly gratifying to Sir Arthur, who, in a few days, consented to rejoin
his family.</p>

<p>The long-neglected Frederick now appeared to gain an interest in his
heart; though a sigh oft swelled his bosom at the recollection of the
deceased Arthur: but, the rising gloom was ever carefully dispelled by
the lively Theodosia, to whom, since the death of his son, he had
behaved with an unwonted show of affection.</p>

<p>Six weeks passed, when the Captain proposed returning to Corbet Hall;
and, knowing the anxiety which preyed on Frederick's mind, respecting
Ellen, he took an<span class="pagenum" title="Pg&nbsp;229">&nbsp;</span><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229"></a> opportunity to mention his engagement with her, to
Sir Arthur: who, contrary to his expectation, readily gave his consent
to their union. When a boy, he said, he had been intimate with her
father, who once saved his life; and as her family was good, indeed
noble, he would wave the consideration of the fortune Frederick, as his
heir, had a right to expect with a wife. He could not, however, he
added, consent to his leaving him entirely; he should pass at least half
his time, till his marriage, with him. To this, Frederick cheerfully
agreed, and, a few days after, returned with the Captain, to Sir
Henry's.</p>

<p>During their absence, Mr. Talton had so far improved his suit, that Mrs.
Blond consented again to enter the marriage<span class="pagenum" title="Pg&nbsp;230">&nbsp;</span><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230"></a> state. The late Sir Henry,
she frankly told him, was the only man she had ever loved. The virtues
and amiable disposition of Blond had merited her esteem and sincerest
friendship; those she had still to give, but nothing farther: her
affections were buried in the tomb of Corbet. The gift, he felt, was
still too valuable to be rejected; and he doubted not he yet might
realize the scenes of domestic happiness he had formerly planned.</p>

<p>As the marriages of Sir Henry and Frederick had been deferred, on
account of the decease of Lady Corbet and young Arthur, it was agreed
that, at the time again appointed for that ceremony, Mrs. Blond should
likewise yield her hand to<span class="pagenum" title="Pg&nbsp;231">&nbsp;</span><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231"></a> Mr. Talton. Edward sighed as he heard these
arrangements; and the Captain, with concern, perceived his increasing
dejection at his unsuccessful inquiry after the fair Unknown, for whom
he had in vain searched the greatest part of Caermarthen. He then
declared his intention of going to Oxford; to inquire if perchance any
of his acquaintance had seen her since he quitted the University? The
Captain could not oppose his determination, and as Louise and Harland
were going to London, to St. Ledger's, they accompanied him to
Oxfordshire, having promised Sir Henry to return to Wales, before the
time appointed for the marriages.</p>

<p>In the mean while, preparations were forwarded for that occasion.
Frederick,<span class="pagenum" title="Pg&nbsp;232">&nbsp;</span><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232"></a> as his father had desired, passed a considerable part of his
time at Howard Hall. Sir Arthur's regard for him appeared daily to
increase, and on Frederick expressing a wish that he would honour the
nuptials with his presence, he instantly complied; and, with Lady Howard
and Theodosia, accompanied him to Sir Henry's. The arrival of Harland
and Louise, with the St. Ledger family, added to the pleasure of their
society. Edward only was absent, who continued a fruitless search, till
the day preceding that fixed for the union of his friends, when he
arrived, so apparently ill, that the Captain began to be seriously
alarmed.</p>

<p>Edward endeavoured to rally his spirits; and on Sir Henry and
Frederick's joining<span class="pagenum" title="Pg&nbsp;233">&nbsp;</span><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233"></a> him, to chide his long desertion, with forced
cheerfulness, answered their good-humoured reproaches, and prepared to
attend them to the drawing-room. The Captain introduced him to their
several friends; but on presenting Theodosia, Edward, with exulting
transports, exclaimed&mdash;"O God, my father! it is my unknown&mdash;&mdash;it is&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Theodosia, the daughter of Sir Arthur Howard," interrupted the Captain,
with vivacity. Sir Arthur, hearing his name, advanced, and instantly
recognised Edward, to whom he proffered his hand, and, reminding him of
the accident at Oxford, renewed his thanks for the service he had
rendered his daughter.<span class="pagenum" title="Pg&nbsp;234">&nbsp;</span><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234"></a></p>

<p>"Your thanks, I am afraid, Sir Arthur," said the Captain, with a smile,
"will not sufficiently recompense my son for that evening's adventure.
He loves your daughter, and has for some months been seeking her. You
know my fortune; if, on a farther acquaintance, you approve him for a
son-in-law, he shall have half at his marriage, the remainder at the
decease of myself and his mother."</p>

<p>Sir Arthur paused a moment&mdash;but the offer was too advantageous to be
rejected, and he readily acceded to it.</p>

<p>"But what says Theodosia?" asked the Captain. "Without her consent, ours
are of no effect."<span class="pagenum" title="Pg&nbsp;235">&nbsp;</span><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235"></a></p>

<p>"Her consent!" repeated Sir Arthur. "She shall consent! Let her refuse
if she dare: I will not again be fooled!"</p>

<p>Theodosia attempted not to reply; the deepest confusion oppressed her;
yet she withdrew not her hand from Edward, but with a timid interceding
glance, raised her eyes to her father. The flush of anger was fast
crimsoning the cheek of Sir Arthur, at the idea of her not according
with the proposal of her uncle, when Lady Howard joined them, and
tenderly taking the hand of her daughter, said&mdash;"Have some
consideration, Sir Arthur, to the delicacy of my girl. Disobedience to a
father she truly loves, is, I am certain, far from her heart or wishes;
but on this subject, unprepared as she was, no<span class="pagenum" title="Pg&nbsp;236">&nbsp;</span><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236"></a> answer could be so
proper as her silence. Your nephew has sincere friends in his cause,
and, aided by time, need not despair of success."</p>

<p>To her mother, Theodosia had mentioned the attention of Edward, when at
Oxford, and their subsequent interview in Wales; pourtraying him in such
favourable colours, and dwelling on each word and incident with such
pleasure and minuteness, as showed he had made no inconsiderable
impression on her heart.</p>

<p>She now directed a look of grateful acknowledgment to Lady Howard, for
the relief she had afforded her, whilst Sir Arthur, in a milder tone,
replied: "Well&mdash;well, Madam, you may be right; but<span class="pagenum" title="Pg&nbsp;237">&nbsp;</span><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237"></a> you know I do not
like to be trifled with."</p>

<p>This discovery, as unexpected as pleasing, added to the happiness of
every individual; nor was Edward long in obtaining a confession; her
affections were too nearly interested in his favour, to let duty have
the merit of her compliance with the wishes of her father.</p>

<p>At last the morn so ardently expected, arrived! The tenants of Sir
Henry, who the same day attained his one-and-twentieth year, assembled
on the lawn, and proceeded with them to church, where Sir Henry, Mr.
Talton, and Frederick, received the hands of their destined brides. Nor
would old Thomas be denied the gratification<span class="pagenum" title="Pg&nbsp;238">&nbsp;</span><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238"></a> of attending his master on
this occasion, at which no one more sincerely rejoiced: he appeared to
have shaken off the infirmities of age; and after the ceremony, joining
the tenants, conducted them back to the lawn, where a noble banquet, by
order of their generous landlord, added to the pleasure of the
peasantry; and a rural ball concluded the day, in which Sir Henry and
his friends did not disdain to join.</p>

<p>For three weeks the Hall and Mr. Talton's house were proclaimed open as
the hearts of their owners; and at the expiration of that time, the
whole party proceeded to the seat of Sir Arthur, where he yielded to the
solicitations of Edward, and resigned the hand of Theodosia. The
liberality<span class="pagenum" title="Pg&nbsp;239">&nbsp;</span><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239"></a> of the Captain on this occasion awakened the generosity of
his brother, and Howard Hall for some weeks vied with the hospitable
mansions of Corbet and Talton. Sir Arthur did more&mdash;he insisted on
resigning the family seat to Frederick and Ellen; himself retiring, with
his Lady, to a smaller one he possessed within less than a mile, where,
as he said, he could daily visit or be visited by them.</p>

<p>Another month, however, elapsed before they thought of separating; and
then with an unanimous promise of frequently visiting each other.</p>

<p>Harland and his Louise returned to Harland Hill, where, a few months
after,<span class="pagenum" title="Pg&nbsp;240">&nbsp;</span><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240"></a> she made him the exulting father of a lovely boy. This
circumstance endeared her not only more to him, but to his parents; at
whose request he relinquished the service, and consented to reside with
them. The amiable manners of Louise had imperceptibly softened the
impatience and harshness of his temper, and his increasing tenderness as
a husband and father, fully justified her in the choice she had made.</p>

<p>Captain Howard purchased an estate near Sir Henry and Mr. Talton's; and
in the society and affection of his Ellenor found an ample recompence
for the years of unhappiness he had experienced on her account. Edward
and Theodosia, at his desire, consented to reside beneath<span class="pagenum" title="Pg&nbsp;241">&nbsp;</span><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241"></a> his paternal
roof: whilst Sir Arthur, who since the death of his son had shown an
unusual urbanity of disposition, again regarded him with fraternal
kindness, which was returned with the sincerest friendship by the
Captain.</p>

<p>Time softened the sorrow of the worthy Booyers for the loss of Hannah;
and, though he ever dwelt on her memory with tenderness, he no longer
felt those poignant emotions, the remembrance or mention of her would at
one time have occasioned. Frederick, with a delicacy equal to his
regard, presented him with an estate adjoining Howard Hall, which
produced him an easy competence: from the happiness of Ellen he derived
his own, and in her children found a source of amusement for his
declining age.<span class="pagenum" title="Pg&nbsp;242">&nbsp;</span><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242"></a></p>

<p>Mr. Talton was justified in his choice of Mrs. Blond; nor had either of
them cause to regret the day on which they were united. So far from
deeming her remembrance of Corbet or Blond a slight to himself, he would
join her in the praise he thought justly due to their merits. This
behaviour increased the regard of his wife; and if a sigh sometimes
obtruded for their unhappy fate, the recollection of Talton never failed
to restore her cheerfulness.</p>

<p>For Mrs. St. Ledger (the once unfortunate Sister Françoise), Louise
retained the sincerest regard; whilst the friendship of that amiable
woman fully recompensed her for the loss of her mother.&mdash;Three years
after her marriage, the Marquis de Valois and his family returned to
France,<span class="pagenum" title="Pg&nbsp;243">&nbsp;</span><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243"></a> whither Harland attended his Louise, and they passed some
months at the seat of that nobleman. On their return to England, in
which they were <ins title="accomcompanied">accompanied</ins>
by the Marchioness and her daughters, they were surprised, on entering
Abbeville, by the appearance of Mallet; his dress immediately informed
them he was in the service of the French Monarch, though in the lowest
rank. He as instantly recognized Louise, who, with mingled sensations of
pleasure and grief, received his embrace. He had, on quitting England,
proceeded to Paris, where the gaming-table soon despoiled him of the
wealth he had obtained from Lady Corbet. He then for some time gained a
precarious livelihood, by practising those wiles by which himself had
been defrauded;<span class="pagenum" title="Pg&nbsp;244">&nbsp;</span><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244"></a> but being detected, was obliged to fly, and as a last
resource for the preservation of existence, had taken up a musket. These
adventures, glossed over with the title of misfortunes, fully awakened
the pity of Harland, who readily complied with the wish of Louise, to
settle an annuity on him for life; he would have urged his return to
England, but Mallet declared his resolution never to revisit his native
country. He had, he said, since the death of Lady Corbet, entered into
other engagements, which he by no means wished to break, though he
declared himself extremely willing to quit the army. They accordingly
procured his discharge, and presenting him with a sum of money for
immediate use, he set out for the south of France, where he proposed<span class="pagenum" title="Pg&nbsp;245">&nbsp;</span><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245"></a> to
fix his residence, whilst Harland and Louise continued their way toward
England, where the society of her friends soon obliterated the painful
remembrance of an unworthy parent.</p>

<p>Old Thomas, at his earnest solicitation, still continued with Sir Henry;
who, feeling himself indebted to that faithful servant for the
restoration of his fortune, would have made him independent: but no
consideration could induce him to accept of any reward which should
separate him from his master; with whom he begged he might pass the
remainder of his days. Sir Henry yielded to his wish; and by every
indulgence strove to requite the services he had rendered him.<span class="pagenum" title="Pg&nbsp;246">&nbsp;</span><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246"></a></p>

<p>Sir Henry, satisfied with his own conduct, could look back on every
action without regret, and to each succeeding day with confidence and
pleasure. Revered by his dependants, and esteemed by all who knew him,
he experienced the true delight of a benevolent heart; whilst in the
affection of Eliza and his children, and the warm attachment of his
friends, he found a recompence for the sorrows he had formerly known.</p>

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement

works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in

before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project

received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity

is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,

that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
